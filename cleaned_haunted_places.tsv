Ada	United States	"Ada witch - Sometimes you can see a misty blue figure floating within a 3-mile radius of the Ada Cemetery on 2 Mile between Egypt Valley and Honey Creek. The story of her origin is as follows: A man suspected his wife of having an affair, so he followed her late one night when she thought he was asleep. Sure enough, she went to a field near their property where she met her lover. The husband was enraged and killed his wife, which resulted in a struggle with the other man. Both men died from their injuries. It is said that late at night (especially during the night of and the nights preceding a full moon) people driving by the field can see her ghost, searching for her lover. Some people have reported stopping to try to communicate with her, but she always disappears or runs into the woods where she cannot be followed (due to the thick brambles that inhabit the area). She is said to dress in a long white gown which authorities say dates her to the turn of the 20th century. Usually she is seen alone, but sometimes witnesses report seeing a ghostly death scene re-enacted... Others report seeing nothing at all but hearing the killer's shouts of rage followed by the victims' screams of agony... Although it is said she haunts the field on Honeycreek Road where she died, other witnesses have reported her in nearby Seidman Park, and in nearby Findlay Cemetery, where she is supposedly buried. This story was actually featured in the book ""Ghosts of Grand Rapids."""

Adrian	United States	In the 1970's, one room, room 211, in the old section of the dorms exhibited several phenomena. Don't know if this still continues today. The door into the room from the hallway, as well as the door into the bathroom, would open and shut on their own, the main door even if it had been locked. After closing, it would be locked again. There was also a spot on one wall (a wall that the room shared with a boarded up, no longer used laundry shaft) where two points of light would appear, shaped similar to eyes. Attempts were made to explain their appearance (they were visible any time it was dark in the room). They were screened off from the windows to see if they might be reflections, they weren't. When objects were placed between them and the windows they actually became brighter. We tried painting the walls, putting several coats of paint over them (thinking they may have been a joke of a previous resident, made with glow in the dark paint) - also having used sandpaper on the wall in that spot first before painting. They still appeared bright as ever after the painting. We tried covering them over by hanging a picture over them, but the picture kept falling down or moving. Last attempt to hang picture (it was a drawing on a piece of paper and simply taped to the wall) resulted in us waking up the next morning to find it taped to the ceiling over my bed. We finally moved a tall dresser in front of it and that seemed to take care of it. Reports from later residents told us that they had placed a mirror over it, and they had a rocker in the room. One night during a party, with several witnesses, the rocker began rocking on its own, then flew back and smashed the mirror. Have had no contact with the school since graduation, so don't know if these things still happen or not.

Central Lake	United States	The Lamplights Inn has been a landmark in Central Lake since 1924. It was built in the very early 1900s. Beginning in the early '50s, the successive owners have had persistent reports of ghosts. A man and woman dressed in late '20s - early '30s garb have been seen many times over the years, not only by owners' families, but also by employees and customers alike. The descriptions are uncannily similar. A customer recently reported the man and woman ghosts dancing together in the bar area with a little girl ghost looking on. These ghosts also window peep (on the second floor). They certainly appear to be fun loving. Another story tells of the daughter of a former hotel manager, who was preparing to elope with her fiancée, and tripped on her gown while descending the ladder. She fell to her death and returns to walk the hallway upstairs in her wedding gown. And, it is a fact that Mrs. Gill who, with her husband, were the first managers of the hotel, returned and lived out her remaining years at the hotel. She died in the early '50s in one of the upstairs bedrooms. Many people have reported seeing her stand in the upstairs window looking onto the village.

Clinton Township	United States	There have been several acts of violence here. About 20 years ago a man escaped from a mental home and broke into the front office. In the process he broke several windows, trashed the place, slit his wrists and neck, and was found by the sales staff in the morning wrapped in a blanket talking to himself. He did not die but it was a very violent experience. 10 or so years ago a man was distressed over losing his parents and shot himself in the head overnight on top of his parent s grave. Several of the grounds crew have seen a man dematerialize in the same area a few times. This was in the summit hill garden which is the oldest garden in the cemetery. In the day or night there can be an overwhelming feeling of being watched. About 6 or 7 years ago there was a sales manager who quit after seeing an Indian in the sales office walk thru a wall. There is also a story not verified that a police officer shot a teenager on the grounds and the boy died and was buried there. In the months following the cop went mad and one night was caught wearing camouflage and face paint digging up the boy that he killed. There have also been a few graves that people have tried to dig up but have failed since the vault lids are VERY heavy. Whispers and screams have been heard.

Harrison	United States	There are many stories about this house. One is the mother (Mrs. Reinke) was standing in her kitchen putting away groceries, and looked up and saw twin daughters (around 6 years old) holding hands and walking toward her. They walked right past her and out the door down towards Budd Lake. Another story is the large man story. Mr. Reinke was tying up his boat when he looked up into his bedroom window and saw a large figure of a man in the window. He rushed up to make sure everything was ok and when he got there, nothing was in the room. Soon after, another sighting of this large man happened. The daughter was sleeping when she noticed that a light was coming from her closet. The way the light comes through the window it would be impossible to be shining into the closet. She looked away, and when she looked back, saw a large man in her closet, the same man her dad had seen earlier. She described the man looking just the way her dad had seen, and he hadn't told anyone about the man yet (he didn't want to look stupid). The next day, the whole family was out of the house, and no one had been there all day. When the daughter came home, she found her room in total shambles, everything in the closet had been thrown around, and figurines and other possessions where seen lying on the ground. Another story has to do with the son. One night he could hear a bouncing ball in the attic above his room. He hears it about once every month or so, and if he gets annoyed with it, he tells the ghost or whatever is bouncing the ball to quit, and it usually does. He is very used to it, and it doesn't scare him anymore to hear it. All of the son's friends are afraid to sleep in the house, and will not really sleep in any rooms alone.

By 3 A.M that night, four of them were dead, and the last kid survived in the scatter, but refused to explain what had happened, or how he'd survived, to police or anyone.  On the first Saturday of every month between 2 and 3 A.M, if survived walks to the gate, and waits to safely guide you through.

Just west of that is a long lay of Grand River Valley land that once was the lumbertown of Austerlitz. There is much forgotton and paved-over history there. In the 1980's motorists returning home from Grand Rapids at night told of a woman who stood on the corner of Brewer and Cannonsburg roads she wore no coat, though the weather at the times during which she appeared was always disagreable. She was seen in cold rains and wet snows. This rural area just at the edge of town was not completely desolate so there are no stories of motorists stopping to offer the apparition a ride. As the stories go, she never thumbed or indicated in any way that that she was in distress, she just stood there enduring the elements. Could she have been a live person? Doubtfull, Homes were far enough away from Oakwood that there would have been no reason for a young woman to stand out on that corner late at night in nasty weath with no coat.

Lambertville	United States	Verna Drive - Update: The following reported haunting is a hoax.- The Monroe County Paranormal Society have just investigated this claim and their contacts in the sheriff's department tell them that there has never been such a murder in the entire county, let alone in the quiet of Bedford Township. Also Lambert Estates also has never existed. One also has to wonder how such a horrific tragedy as the game show story never even made it to the local news. - Off Monroe Road in Lambertville, Michigan, there is a subdivision called Lambert Estates. Lambert Estates is mostly made up of a road called Verna Drive. The subdivision was formed in 1957. In the early summer of 1978, Steven Madison, a 33-year-old worker for a glass plant in Toledo, Ohio, walked into a home on Verna Drive and killed an elderly couple with a hammer found in the garage. He then moved into several other houses that night, and killed 7 others. 3 male adults, 1 female adult, 2 male children, and 2 female children. He used a block of firewood to kill a family of 3, a wood saw to kill a young college graduate, and smothered or strangled the other 3. He then went into the woods next to the neighborhood and hung himself from a maple tree. Reports of screams often come from two houses in the neighborhood. In the early July's, residents report a figure of a man walking down the street carrying a piece of firewood wearing a green shirt and jeans that appear to be blood stained. A neighbor once approached the man after seeing him 3 consecutive nights. When the man was asked who he was, he turned and faced the resident with a frightening wide grin and wide eyes. He walked off after not responding and disappeared in the front yard of an residents house. He was also reported seen in the woods, hanging from a tree, when the owner of the woods walked in one evening while walking his dog. He noticed nothing out of the ordinary at first, until when standing under a tree; drops of water fell on him. He looked up and saw him hanging by his neck as if he just died. The water was apparently tears that the man shed. An investigation was conducted to investigate the level of paranormal activity. The investigation was part of a game show where a group of people spent a week in the now abandoned neighborhood, to determine whether it was haunted. By the end of the week, a member of the investigating team disappeared and had not been found until two months later. He was found nearly dead in the glass plant in Toledo wear Steven Madison was employed. To this day the neighborhood remains empty, yet still stands. - June 2008 Update - The first posting for Lambert estates indicates it is abandoned. The update then states that the neighborhood never existed. Actually, not only has it existed, it remains very much occupied to this day. Every house is very well maintained. However, it is not in Temperance, it is in Lambertville, the next town over.	formerly listed in Temperance	Michigan	MI	-83.62601099999999	41.75810800000001	-83.624201	41.75290880000001	1957-01-01		1957-01-01	1957.0	1957.0	True		False	True

Manitoulin Island	United States	- Drummond Island - Drummond Island is said to be haunted by two ghosts of headless British soldiers. During the War of 1812 there where two British soldiers who went AWOL, and a price was placed on their heads. Two Indians near the fort ran off on snowshoes to pursue the deserters. The deserters had built a fire to warm themselves on Manitoulin Island (in Canada now) and began to doze while sitting by their large blaze. The Indians snuck up behind them and with a few swift chops of their hatchets the soldiers were decapitated. The Indians brought their heads back to the fort and collected their bounty. Now people say sometimes you can see a fire burning on the shore and two headless figures pacing around it. Some people claim to have driven up quite close in their boat and had the whole scene disappear before them.

Marine City	United States	"Once in a great while employees of the kitchen claim that machines will turn on when no one is around, such as mixers, dishwasher, etc. The very rare occasions have pretty much stopped but just recently in the summer of 2003 a radio/C.D. player boombox was said to ""have a mind of it's own"". It started with the volume increasing by it's self over the corse of 5-10 minutes to the point where it was full blast and had to be turned down. But a little while later it would turn it's self up again, blaring loud and causing frusteration among employees. One Sunday morning during a busy breakfast rush, a frusterated employee turned the power button off since it wouldn't stay at a reasonable volume level. Minutes later the radio suddenly turned on loud as can be. The red-faced employee turned it off again, and five minutes later the words ""sugar, sugar, oh honey, honey!"" came blaring out of the speakers (the radio station was placed at 104.3, oldies station). The employee grabbed the radio, unplugged it and sat it underneath a table. This ended the incents for that day and the night crew workers claimed they had no problems with the radio at all after they plugged it in that same night. All week the radio was fine until Sunday morning came. The breakfast buffet near the dining room was getting busy and kitchen workers became busy as well. The radio started turning it's self up again. The same employee from last Sunday battled it for 2 hours having to turn the volume down every 10-15 minutes. Everyone thought it was broken or something. He eventually turned it off and became very frusterated. And about 20 minutes later, the song ""Edge Of Seventeen"" by Stevie Nicks suddenly blared from the radio. The employee stared at the radio shaking his head as workers yelled for him to turn it down. He gritted his teeth, unplugged it, and wrapped the cord around it. It remained silent and still for an hour until it suddenly ""hurled it's self towards him"" but missed him by a few inches and hit the floor. The radio was permanently shot and would not work after this incident. Other strange incidents involved objects disappearing (knives, utinsils, etc.) while employees were just using them seconds earlier. After searching the kitchen for them they would be neatly placed where the cooks had originally placed them. Also, the same employee that dealed with the radio incident claimed that vegetables such as squash, potatoes, etc. would be neatly placed on a cutting board but nobody needed them and would have to be put back. This also occured with other items. One time a 5-gallon jug of milk was found sitting on a table in the kitchen. After checking the milk machine it was full with milk. He asked around if anyone got the milk out. Puzzled, the waitresses said no. He placed the milk jug back in the walk in refrigerator. He began chopping up some vegetables when all of the sudden an entire shelf of pizza pans (about 15 inches wide and 30 inches high) fell spreading loud bobbling pizza pans all over the floor. Seconds later 3 metal hotel pans fell off a shelf causing a he racket. The frusterated employee walked out, but returned the next day for work. This was like the grand finale for the poltergeist, if it even was a poltergeist, because nothing has happened since for several months. These events started out of the blue and only lasted two weeks and then abruptly stopped. Even before they occured nothing unusual ever happened there for years."

Northville	United States	In the old city of Northville in the 40's and 50's, were many insane asylums. They were not even a mile apart and ran through the whole town. They were all linked underneath the ground, for underground passages of very mentally ill patients and there's rumors that that's where many of the out of control patients were punished, not to alarm the others. The tunnels go all through the town, and under buildings, which are now on the place of the asylums. The tunnels are blocked off but the people who are brave enough to go in have experienced screaming, voices, moaning and orbs. Feelings of people behind you, crashes against the walls, and more. The tunnels are miles long and are tight compacted areas. There is a 200 dollar fine for anyone to go there, seeing as the late 80's and 90's brought many Satanists there trying to summon up spirits. -  Update: The buildings of the insane asylum have now been torn down and they are building a sub-division on the land. They had tried many times to get a company to come and build there and always something went wrong. They finally got some company to build expensive homes there and now there is a worry for the people who purchase their homes there. It is the whole block on the north-east corner of Sheldon and 5 mile roads.	Northville Tunnels	Michigan	MI			-83.4832692	42.4311464	0200-02-26				Unknown	False	Unknown	True	True

After that, it was expanded and Detroit Diesel occupied it for years, where it is said a man committed suicide there. That part of the complex is now used by Ford Motor Co as a warehouse. At any time during the day and night you can hear voices and sounds as if people are working with tools like they are building something. Many times, they call out to you by your name, leaving workers to answer back to no one! Carts move all by themselves, and several of the workers have had their clothes tugged on and have been tapped on the back, only to find they are alone in the area. You can hear someone enter the toilet stall next to you, only to find no one there. Several times, workers have approached strangers, thinking they were employees, only to see them disappear into the air! Even disbelievers agree that something is going on there.

The dad and his friend buried the horse on the side of their house. If you go to the side of the house where the dad and his friend buried the horse, there will be a little hill where the horse is. When the little girl came home and found out what her dad did, everyday from then on, she would come home from school, lock hers in her room, put her rocking chair in front of her window and she would sing to herself. Well, when the family died and Henry Ford bought the house, that was then the hospital, there was an old man that was in the hospital and his hospital room was what used to be the little girl's bedroom. While he was lying there in his bed, he heard singing, then he heard footsteps. When he got out of the hospital, he had someone set up thermal cameras in the room he was in and sure enough, they saw a figure in front of the window. After Henry Ford bought the hospital, six doctors wanted to build a bigger one and that's how the newer Riverside Hospital came about. They ended up closing down the old hospital 5 years ago because they found black mold growing in the building, which can kill you. They closed down the newer hospital one year ago because it was too much to keep up. Also, the Henry Ford company wanted to move everything to Wyandotte so Riverside lost business. There is a stack by the hospital. In a little tunnel thing outside of the new hospital, there is a furnace type thing. That's where they burned the amputated body parts of people. Also in that little tunnel, is the old morgue. THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL SEEN IN THE WINDOW THAT WAS MENTIONED ABOVE. SHE WAS WEARING A WHITE DRESS WITH BROWN CURLY HAIR AND BOWS IN HER HAIR.

Altoona	United States	"Beulah Road -  This legend is a cross between the spectral hitchhiker stories you have heard before and the sort of ""Resurrection Mary"" type tales familiar to the Chicago area. the ghost of the white lady still walks at night. For historical background there used to be a hotel at the top of the Wopsononock Mountain that was a fairly common getaway for people in Altoona. The Wopsononock hotel and famous lookout burned in the early part of the 20th century and was never rebuilt. In fact, at one time it was serviced by a narrow gauge railroad know as the ""Alley Popper"" although that has nothing to do with this tale. The road heading up to the Wopsy Lookout (as it is known hereabouts) is now Juniata Gap road in Altoona. This road is a treacherous one bearing a curve known as the ""Devil's Elbow"" which has been the scene of many accidents. Apparently in the early part of the century a couple was married and was heading to the hotel at the lookout for their honeymoon. I know nothing of the father chasing them which is related to the Ebensburg tale you have given. The legend goes that they were both from Altoona and were heading up the road leading to the hotel when the carriage went over the edge rounding the Devil's Elbow. Both were apparently killed but the body of the husband was never recovered. Since then travelers on this road have encountered the specter of a woman in white, sometimes seen to be carrying a candle, who apparently is looking for something. Variations on the tale have her waylaying young men and looking them over to see if they are her husband, or hitching rides with young men headed for the top of the mountain and then disappearing near the Devil's Elbow. Apparently this spirit has also been seen on the road leading up the mountain where the lookout can be accessed from the other direction, Buckhorn Mountain, and she is also known as the ""White Lady of the Buckhorn"" as well as the ""White Lady of Wopsononock"". The site of the old hotel now is littered with television and radio towers and is still a sort of ""lover's lane"" spot for a lot of folks. Apparently some of the technicians at the towers have reported seeing her, but the most recent account (late 1990's) involved a man who offered her a ride. She apparently got into the car and he could not see her in the rear view mirror but could see her when he turned around. She said nothing to him and disappeared at the Devil's Elbow. Much like Resurrection Mary, it is a difficult tale to dispute since it has occurred so often to so many people over such a long stretch of time. Although the historical details are sketchy! No one knows who she was or when the accident actually took place. If you ever get a chance to get to this area take a trip on either road and you may get a chance to run into her."

Beaver	United States	Mudlick Hollow - It is said that in the 1800s tragedy struck when a young newlywed couple was riding their horse drawn buggy through the hollow on their way home after the wedding. A small animal is said to have darted out of the woods, spooking the horses and causing the buggy to roll off the road and into the creek. The bride died from a broken neck and the groom was pinned under a horse (who had become lame) and slowly died next to his new bride.

Carbon County	United States	Jim Thorpe - The old Carbon County Prison was last used in 1995. There have been numerous reports of unexplained phenomena at the prison in recent years. The most famous ghost story associated with the prison is the hand print left in a cell by a man wrongfully accused of being a member of the Molly Maguires. The Molly Maguires were a group of disgruntled miners in the 1870's who used violence as a means to bring about change in the corrupt mining industry. Several men were accused, arrested, and eventually hanged at the prison for being Molly Maguires. On the eve of his execution, a man who proclaimed his innocence ran his hand along the dirty floor of his cell and made an impression of his hand on the wall, claiming the impression would always remain as proof of his innocence. The next day, he was hung and the hand print was washed away. Three days later, the print reappeared. As legend has it, the wall has been repeatedly washed and painted, but the hand print always returns. The wall was supposedly even ripped down and re-plastered, but the hand print returned yet again. The prison is now opened to tourist, but the cell with the hand print is off limits. Visitors can still view the print through the cell door, though.	old Carbon County Prison	Pennsylvania	PA	-75.78172529999999	40.8775327	-75.667356	40.901975	1995-01-01		1995-01-01	1995.0	1995.0	True		False	True

Drexel Hill	United States	"Originally the old Drexel Estate and then later before the school an orphanage- there are 2 tales here. The 1st is the story of an orphan that was murdered by another. On the second floor of the school there are still 2 halls left with the original bedrooms- still not converted to classrooms. The halls are on the same floor as the chapel. Students have claimed to see furniture move in those rooms. There is 1 old rocking horse in particular that will ALWAYS MOVE ON ITS OWN when the room is occupied for too long. Because of the hostile vibe felt in that room, people believe that is the spirit of the murdering orphan, who also died there due to a ""freak"" accident. There are also reports of students seeing two children late at night, running, fighting, and screaming through those halls. The 2nd story is the tale of a nun who taught at the orphanage. She hung herself in the bell tower and haunts it to this day. Many times the bell will ring unexpectedly and late at night a light will go on and off. Unlike the modern light that is suppose to be up there (which seems to always mysteriously short out), it looks like a candle. Students who have tried to get up there have been spooked severely. The school has had the bell tower sealed off for years. Some students have reported coming back from school dances and looking up to see the nun looking at them from the bell tower."

Harrisburg	United States	Harrisburg State Hospital was an insane asylum for over 150 years. It admitted its first patient in 1851 as The Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital. It is located on the outskirts of city limits of Harrisburg on a 200 acre plot, most of which falls within Susquehanna Township lines. There is an entrance on Cameron St. across from the Farm Show complex and another one off of Elmerton Ave. A hiking and biking trail called the Capital Area Green Belt leads into another entrance in the Edgemont area of the city. It closed its doors as an asylum in 2006, but the grounds and buildings are still in use today as offices for several state agencies such as the PA Office of Mental Health. There are now over 50 buildings on the grounds, although a large portion of the land is still Woodland. Many different noises from screams to footsteps are heard and many different visuals ranging from shadows to full-bodied apparitions are witnessed. The morgue, although very tiny, is 2 stories tall and the basement leads into the tunnels. There are large blood-like stains on the floor and all the exam tables are still there. There is also poltergeist activity reported in the various buildings. Be warned, it may be illegal to be on the property at night and there are some security guards. The morgue, stables, and some of the tunnel entrances are secluded enough to probably not be noticed if entered at night, and since that area is right by the Green Belt, one could enter the property from that entrance and have the car readily available, but it is probably best to try and get permission. It is DEFINITELY illegal to actually be in the tunnels or the morgue, as well as any other buildings that are boarded up or locked.

The cemetery at this church is said to be haunted by the Blue-Eyed Six, a gang that murdered a local man and whose members were all subsequently hung in the cemetery as punishment(a play has been written about this event and was possibly copyrighted). This information is NOT TRUE. The Blue Eyed Six were never related in any way to the church or it's cemetery. Although all these things occured within this area more or less. They never were hung in the cemetery or buried there, nor is it believed they would have any reason to haunt this place as they have no worldy connections. The Blue eyed six were all caught and tried in the Lebanon County Court House, hung in thecourtyard of the Lebanon County prison except Josiah Hummel who died in Prison, and all were buried seperatly on their individual homesteads.

Lehigh	United States	Manorcare Health Services - the ghost of a small boy has been seen in the kitchen. the boy was about 8 or 9 years old, had brown hair and was wearing modern clothing. Each time they encountered this boy he appeared whole to them, just like a normal human being. there wasn't anything else about the boy's appearance that was odd or out of the ordinary. when workers encountered the boy, he would look directly at them then run from them and attempt to hide elsewhere in the kitchen. When they would try to find the boy he was nowhere to be found. Because this activity only happened on the later shifts (2nd&3rd) it would have been all but impossible for anyone, especially a child, to get into any of the buildings without being noticed.

These two playful spirits especially enjoy the company of the current owner’s youngest child.

These two spirits have shared their names with the owner’s youngest child and she will address them by name. They will often bring ""others"" along with them when they come to play. If the owner’s children are not there, these two spirits seem to be unhappy and are more likely to allow others to see them or evidence of them.

Livermore	United States	"Reports of a phantom house, that disappears. From legend and research the place was a town in the 1800's. There was a witch living amongst the people and they burned her alive, as she died she placed a curse of flood on the place and death on the people. On the anniversary of her death there was indeed a great flood, burying the entire town and people in it alive. if you park your car near the gates at night, a train going across the only way out, blocking you in for an hours worth of demon faces in your windows, howling screeching sounds, corpses trying to get at you, and the like. (Remember, in actuality the corpses are still underwater in the town, never recovered). You can actually walk thru this place (beware, there are wild dog packs throughout) and good luck not getting lost. If the waters low enough, you can see the tops of chimneys and houses during the day. Pay close attention to what you hear; sounds even in the daytime are unexplainable and for added fun, try the cemetery off to the left for gravesites of those who died before the flood. Not recommended for ANY child, the place is dangerous. And don't drive thru there, you will get fined at least $500.For more information check out the Westmoreland Historical Association, and look up Livermore. It's all there in black and white.

Manor	United States	"The Norwin Elks used to be the old Fletcher's place. He made jellies and such assortments as that. When it closed down is when all the hauntings were noticed. . . There are 3 distinct hauntings. The first haunting is in the Old Fletcher Barn (Which became the Terror Barn). One of the groundskeepers apparently had nowhere to go when Fletcher's was shutdown, so he thought he'd make a statement to the world by hanging himself in the barn facing the window on the second floor. Working there I noticed the scariest things imaginable would happen. For one thing (and they had this on tape one night while we were making a commercial for the terror barn) the radio (which was located at the other side of the barn in the ""Michael Meyer's Room"") was changing stations rapid ply and shutting off and turning on while we are all meeting in the wizard room (on the other side of the barn, nowhere near Michael Meyers).The second thing, if you lay on the torture rack and look up you can see a man who walks the rafters above. The other thing has to do withhe sound of cowboy boots following you as you walk around. The last thing is above all the scariest, a piercing scream while we were closing one night. The second haunting of the Norwin Elks is located in the bar/dining area. Apparently in the attic there is a specter who you cannot make out, but she/he is there and watches you. Some say that it is a little girl and others say it's a little boy. The third haunting is in the basement of the Norwin Elks. If you walk down there you can hear a dog barking for hours on end, but the Norwin Elks don't have any dogs. And sometimes you see a maintenance man down there who tells you that the pipes of the furnace need a cleaning, and when you ask them what's wrong he vanishes. There are other reports of a man in the bar who never leaves and when you finally force him outside he vanishes after he leaves the door. But no one can say for certain what happened to any of these ghosts. The only ghost that we know for sure is the Fletcher's Groundskeeper in the terror barn who hung himself."

Mars	United States	"At the turn of the 20th Century, when the station was still fairly new, a small cat lingered in the rooms where its owner worked. It was somewhat of a mascot for the station over the next couple of years. One day, it mysteriously disappeared. When the station was moved in August of 2000, workers found a preserved body of a dead cat in the foundation. After the station was moved, members of the Mars Historical Society began experiencing strange happenings in the old structure. Cat sounds can be heard. What is even more disturbing is that during the restoration work, members discovered paw prints of a cat in the sawdust of a newly cut board. Some members have even reported seeing a small cat wondering around in the rooms. The members have nicknamed the ghost cat, ""Chessie"". It was named after the now retired Chessie System. It is said that Chessie's spirit emerges out of the ground where the station used to be. It runs across the CSX tracks and enters the station where it now sits. Many believe that Chessie searches unsuccessfully for it’s lovable master who is now long gone."

Middletown / Lima	United States	"This county home was established in Media, Pennsylvania in 1807, where it remained until 1857. It then moved to its present location in Lima on the 210-acre Abraham Pennell Farm on Middletown Road. The farm was called ""Fair Acres"", and as a county facility it retained this name. During the early years in Lima, the County facility often cared for entire families as well as individuals in a self-contained environment. A part of this facility was the operation of a farm used for the production of food items for people within the facility. The farming operation was discontinued in 1967 when the facility underwent a transition from a partially residential community to a health care facility and directed its emphasis to elderly residents of Delaware County who required medical and nursing care. With this change, ""farm"" was dropped from the name, and in 1978 the institution became the Fair Acres Geriatric Center. The Center now consists of eighteen buildings located on a 210-acre tract in Lima, Pennsylvania. Five of these are resident buildings, containing both skilled and intermediate care nursing units with total accommodations for over 900 residents.  One building in particular, Building 4, now has many separate offices and a main hallway shared by each office.  This building was originally a big, single room that held hundreds of hospital beds in rows in the late 1800's. An elderly woman with long gray, straight hair and wearing a hospital gown has been seen walking in the hallways.  She has been seen by about 5 different people in different years.

Montrose	United States	The site of the Inn has a long history. The original Inn was used as the first jail, as a funeral home before there was a funeral home in town and as a school room. The original building burned to the ground in the mid 1920's. When the new building was about 90 percent completed it burned to the ground again. The building that stands on the site now, was completed around 1926. Upstairs in the Inn there is a little boy that roams the hall and plays trick at all times of the day and night. He seems to like room #5 the most. More than one guest reported someone knocking on the door and no one being there when the door was opened. One guest in particular complained in the morning about the child that was staying in the Inn. He had upset here during the night with knocking on the door several times during the evening and giggling. There were no other guest in the Inn that night. The shade would be taken off the window and placed neatly on the pillow. The window was about 7 feet away from the bed. The time on the clock would be changed. The arm that was set the night before would not go off ( the alarm clock was changed in that room more than once due to the complaints concerning the alarm not going off). Room doors would open then slowly close. The child was reported as seen only once. He was crouched down with his face toward the corner with his hands over his eyes and he was giggling as though he was playing hide and seek. Downstairs in the Inn is a man that has been seen on many occasions and felt many more. This man was seen walking past the front office into the coat closet on one occasion. He seemed so real that the customer in the dinning room thought that he was about to steal a coat.

South Los Angeles	United States	There are reports of ghostly happenings in the stock rooms of this former Zody's. It is believed that a double murder/suicide took place somewhere in the upstairs stockroom. Apparently, a couple worked together for Zody's and the boyfriend caught his girlfriend in a compromising situation with another male employee. The enraged boyfriend located a box cutter and slashed the two to death. He then slashed his own wrists and carotid artery. After several reports from employees of unusual activity, Kmart headquarters in Michigan has admitted to hiring paranormal/paraphysical investigators to conduct investigations into the incident. The conclusion was that indeed the building was occupied by several spirits. The investigators concluded that four different spirits dwell throughout the building. The fourth has not been linked to any known incident that may have occurred and thus is unknown for its presence. Kmart has remained quiet on the findings of this investigation and resources revealed that employees of this store are not advised of this activity. Prior to changing over to Kmart, Zody's employees reported seeing a man walking about in the stockroom. A woman is also seen running and sometimes screams are heard. In one case, an overnight employee sustained a 7 inch laceration while working in the stockroom. Zody's management insisted that the incident was just an accident caused by falling boxes that were stacked too high, but resources close to the victim tell another tale. A paring knife mysteriously came across the room and cut the employee across the chest. No one was seen in the area. The victim survived his wounds, but obviously resigned from the company. Sightings and sounds have been reported throughout the years, but no one else has been physically attacked since.

Niles	United States	"A young woman who's last name was Lowerey was on her way to a wedding possibly her own. Riding in a horse drawn carriage near the way stop of Scott's Corners, (between Pleasanton and Sunol, CA. Area is now Highway 84/680) she was thrown from the carriage when the horses were spooked by the first of two oncoming horseless carriages (car). After she was thrown the 2nd car struck her. Miss Lowerey became the first person to ever be killed by an automobile in this area. Many have seen a woman in white by the cemetery and near by areas, accompanied with strange lights. - November update: A paranormal researcher found there's quite an extensive collection of newspaper clippings that was donated to the library by a journalist. The clippings go back to the turn of the 20th century, so they cover the period when the ""accident"" happened. According to the first journalist to report on the supposed haunting, about ten years after the date in the 1920's when the woman was popularly held to have died, there was no mention of anyone dying in an accident in the canyon, and county records of the time listed no account of the body of anyone who had supposedly died in Niles Canyon. There was, in the early 50's, a young man who dressed in a white sheet and jumped out in front of motorists near one of the bridges on Halloween. He scared someone so bad that they immediately drove to the nearest phone and called the police, who arrived in force (owing to the legend of the white witch) and drew guns on what they thought was the ghost. The young man was almost shot, though he was not arrested, but he had to be taken to a coffee shop where it took him until 2am to calm down sufficiently to go home. The supposed ""white witch of Niles"" actually follows the scenario of a common fake ghost story, that being the ""hitchhiking ghost"" story. The Niles ghost is most commonly said to hitchhike to one of the bridges in the area, where she disappears at the tollbooth. There is no cemetery that they know of in Sunol, which is at the top of Niles Canyon Rd. Similarly; there is no Morrison Canyon ghost. Morrison Canyon road is a primarily one-lane road that leads up to the 680 freeway. There's even a radar-testing facility up there somewhere, complete with life-size wire models of helicopters and planes, mostly upside down. Now, on the OTHER side of the coin, there ARE photographs of orbs in Mission San Jose's church and in the graveyard, though the investigator does not own them. The church, the cemetery and the grounds are VERY active."

Sacramento	United States	There are a series of tunnels that run under Old Sacramento. These tunnels were originally the streets of Sacramento before the first 8 or so blocks next to the river were raised above sea level to avoid flooding. Apparently, the tunnels had served as opium dens, brothels and possibly for ritualistic activity at some point. Several business owners with access to the tunnels have reported an extremely menacing energy and strange noises coming from the tunnels, and went so far as to hire a paranormal investigator. Rumor is that the tunnels are now sealed off. - August 2005: A visitor to our site reports that the rumor is FALSE - people can still enter the old tunnels through basements of the older buildings in Old Town Sacramento, as long as they have the property owner's permission or are in the company of the property's owner. It is reported everything is still preserved.	Tunnels under Old Sacramento	California	CA	-121.5051321	38.5827305	-121.4943996	38.5815719	2005-01-01		2005-01-01	2005.0	2005.0	True		False	True
Salinas	United States	Old stage road has been known for many hauntings. It runs right outside of Salinas and goes through the back roads of King city.

San Gabriel	United States	The San Gabriel Civic Auditorium s past is very long and there are many stories of hauntings. Back was being built underground tunnels were built under the length of the building. They were built so that the owner (nicknamed Uncle John) could go from backstage to the foyer. When Uncle John died the tunnels went unused for years and when the depression came those tunnels were used as catacombs to house dead bodies. Once they were filled the catacombs were sealed. In the men s restroom in the front there is a door. When you open that door there is just a brick wall. When a crew tried to breach the wall they got five feet and there was still brick. Why would some one seal a tunnel in more than five feet of brick? No one will ever know unless the try to breach it again. Now to the stories. There is a drop that was preserved because it was the only remaining drop from the original stage. Some times during the Temple City High School musical that drop swings unintentionally. There is no wind and no one ever touched that drop. A psychic was brought in and they said they saw a man swing on the drop. Another story is that there are TV monitors on stage left that broadcast what is being shown on stage. In 2003 and there during the Music Man there was a person seen in the second story window on one of the houses. Many stage crew, tech crew, and actors saw this man on the TV monitor. Also many of the audience saw this man too. The problem with this is that there is no way for a man to be standing in the second story window because there is no ledge or anything for him to stand on. The man was later recognized as Uncle John. There are also stories of a little girl who roams the halls and a old stage manager who roams the halls at night.

Hot Springs	United States	This old estate is located on Highway 270, five miles east of Crystal Springs, close to the Garland/Montgomery County line. It is said to be haunted by the ghost of David Mayberry, the man who owned the Mayberry Inn during the 1800s. Legend states that David Mayberry used his inn to shelter prospectors and miners that were traveling through the area. Gunfights quite often broke out between the men, which led to the death of many people. It is said that one of the men's bloodstains can still be found on the inn's floor. The violence in the inn also led to David Mayberry getting shot. Although Mayberry was not killed, the bullets left in his body led to schizophrenia. Supposedly, because of his mental condition, Mayberry stabbed his wife to death and burned her body in the fireplace( which is still intact and displays a creepy message on the wall above it). Eerily enough, legend states that you will hear the wife of David Mayberry crying hysterically at exactly midnight. Also, legend states that Mayberry, after he killed his wife, drowned his infant son. Mysterious screaming can be heard coming from the bath tub in the basement.

Hot Springs	United States	A former worker, and one of the people who helped run the place told this story. It was on a Wednesday before the regular poetry reading. A woman was awake on a couch, but she couldn’t get her eyes to open completely. With her blurred vision, she thought she saw her friend walk into the kitchen. The woman asked a man sitting in a chair near her if there was anyone else in the room. The man told her that everyone was in the kitchen. She then felt a pair of female hands grab her roughly and hold her down to the couch. She yelled out to the guy sitting in the chair, asking if there was anyone else in the room. He went to the kitchen and saw that no one was there and told her that they were the only two people there. As soon as he told her that, the hands let go. When the woman arrived for work the next day, she told her coworkers the story. She said that she had seen he r friend out of the corner of her eye, and that the friend was wearing the exact same clothes that she saw him wearing earlier that day. The other person who was with her at the time said that he had been sitting in the chair the whole time, and had seen nothing out of the ordinary.

He died in the stand-off, and his spirit is said to be there still. Back in the 1950's, a family worked there as housekeepers. They experienced a lot of ghost activity at the three-story lodge. About five years ago, a family went on a tour of the lodge. It was a very warm summer day. They headed up the stairs, looking at the rooms. They were aware of the reported hauntings and they were scared. As they got closer to the third floor, the air got very cold(remember it was a very warm day outside). They went to the room where the man died long ago on the third floor. They don't know if it was a setup by the hotel owner, but there was a very dusty wooden chair in the room. It had an imprint on it, that looked as if someone sat on it recently. There was a smell of smoke from a cigarette in the small room. The owner told them that the ghost often likes to smoke in the room.	Tazlina Lodge	Arkansas	AR					1950-01-01		1950-01-01	1950.0	1950.0	True		False	True

Anyway, several people have gone up the hill and have told me that there is a spot that has a bunch of rocks placed in a circle in the center is a pile of animal bones, but when the people went back up to find that place again, its always gone, and they will go up several times in search of it. Anyway old OIT had a dorm two school buildings and a gym that had a small swimming pool. There is one wall left, and a small area that has three walls and a cement floor. They are maybe 50 feet apart. Anyway, several people, credible witnesses say that they have seen apparitions, sometimes a fog in those two areas. Also if you go at night, you can hear sounds like people chanting, or footsteps if you sit in car with the lights off right next to those two buildings. Also just up the road from old OIT there is a hill, or at least what appears to be one. It’s a small vortex. One of the urban legends is that an old Indian was hung from a tree on that hill right next to the road. If you park under the tree, he will push you up the hill.

La Puente	United States	workers claim to see little kids running around the theater and then they suddenly vanish into thin air. - Update & a little background info: The Puente Hills Mall AMC theater was attached to the mall until 1996 The Broadway Department Store was known by employees to be very haunted. On the third floor, stock workers were frightened by music coming from a locked and empty stockroom, and the area of the freight elevator was quite simply a terrifying place for me to work in. Workers had feelings of panic and chills. On the second floor, employees heard their names called by someone unseen (this was a very common occurrence, experienced even by non-believers), clothing would swing on racks as though someone were walking between the racks, cool breezes and the sound of breathing were felt and heard in the stockrooms of the Children 's Department, and several times before the store opened employees heard the sounds of someone straightening the racks in the Lingerie department, and see two legs wearing black pants standing behind a tall fixture (on which were hung bathrobes, etc.), but the sounds and legs disappeared when they went to see who was working. All of this occurred both before, during, and after store hours. Also, in the second floor freight area, they would see people passing the door of the room in which they were working, but no one was present when they checked the hallway. This, too, was a common activity. The first floor had similar activities, but employees working after hours in the freight dock would see what we thought were customers passing the windows of the dock doors, but when investigated, the store was empty. One dock guy quit after he experienced this a couple of times. The store was closed and torn down in 1996, and the theater was built. Reportedly only one person ever died on the store property: a manager had a heart attack while at work, and died while they were loading her into the ambulance. A child was severely injured once while playing on the escalator from the second to the first floor, and his blood stains had soaked into the tile at the foot of the escalator and remained until the store was destroyed.

One thing is that the school was built in the 1920's and that the school's name was changed to honor Alexander Fleming. The submitter does not remember the school's original name but the name change occurred in the 1940's. The third floor can only be reached by a rather steep set of stairs. The third floor was seldom used because of this fact. There is one hallway up there with about 20 rooms in total, 10 on each side of the hall. Some classes where held on the third floor but it was mostly unused.

Los Angeles	United States	"Westminster Ave. Apartment Bldg. - Charlie Chaplin used to own several of the large buildings that sit near or along the famous Venice Beach Boardwalk in Los Angeles. In the day, these buildings were commonly used as bath houses or lodging for wealthy vacationers. Today, these buildings have been converted to apartment buildings for the local artists, musicians, and other creative types that now inhabit Venice Beach. Incidentally these buildings cradle around the famous Building Number 26 on Westminster Ave. It has been documented in print as well as Chaplin's films that during the early 1900's he did much of his filming in and around these properties on Westminster Avenue. In 1915, during the filming of ""By the Sea"" Chaplin's stunt double mysteriously disappeared from the film set. Production was put on hold for three days and a full on man-hunt was instated. After tur ning up empty-handed, it was assumed that the long time friend of Chaplin's must have quit and left on his on recognizance. The studios that were financially backing the film, were losing money. Under haste, Chaplin was forced to replace his stunt double and continue production of the film. On the seventh day after the disappearance, Chaplin returned to his dressing room after a day of shooting. His dressing room was located in the basement of the now famous Building number 26 on Westminster. It is documented that Chaplin, while accompanied by an entourage, entered the room to discover his stunt double and long time friend lying dead on the floor, wet and covered in seaweed. The man appeared to have been deceased for several days. How he had ended up on the floor of Chaplin's dressing room after missing for almost an entire week, is still to this day a complete mystery. The ""now"" inhabitants of the famous building claim to still hear strange noises emanating from th e walls of somebody walking through shallow water. Other noises include moaning, and sounds of someone distantly crying for help. In addition to the assortment of disturbing sounds, there have been several sightings of what appears to be an apparition of a man bound by the hands and feet standing in luminous corners of the large building. Quite possibly the most blood curdling detail of all these sightings is what the man is seen wearing. He's dressed the same way he was the day he disappeared. A Chaplin-esque tuxedo coat with tails and the proverbial black derby hat."

Flagstaff	United States	Has recently been purchased by a new owner - Between 1995 and 1999, many of the staff had experienced odd occurrences. A janitor, cleaning late at night when the theatre was closed for the evening, saw a dark figure floating back and forth through the aisles of the balcony. Another time, while the final movie was playing for the evening, three staff members watched as a roll of paper towels hanging on the wall in the concession stand, rapidly started to unravel onto the floor. One employee put his hand out to stop it. It stopped until he removed his hand, and then it started up again. Employees and patrons reported that when they would walk into the men’s room, they would sense that something was there. It would be a weird electrical vibration, as if you were to accidentally shock yourself while plugging something in. It’s only mild and it just seems to flood the ro om from ceiling to floor. One evening after closing, there was a report of toilets flushing and sinks turning on at full blast. In the projection room at the very top of the balcony, there was a crawlspace with a ladder that led to a lower level of the roof, right above the marquee.

Reisterstown	United States	Gravesite of witch who taunted townspeople in the 1800's. Before she was hanged and cut in two by an angry mob, she put a curse on Reisterstown saying if anybody visited her grave, her two halves would crawl closer to each other until one day, they would become whole. For assurance, the townspeople buried her upper half on one side of Reisterstown in a grave marked UPPER MELINDA. The other grave in unmarked and has not been found till this day. - February 2007 Additional information: A group of investigators entered several buildings nothing too strange had happened. Then on the way out they decided to go inside one last building. They found a stair case. They heard sounds of feet shuffling and people talking above us. They assumed it was other board kids but when they reached the 2nd floor, they found nobody. The only way down would have been the stairs they came up. They all decided to leave. As they started to walk away from the building, one noticed that there was a light on in a window on the 2nd floor.

Pawhuska	United States	The Pizza Hut Ghost has haunted the pizza hut in Pawhuska for many years. The rumor is that before it was a restaurant that it was a house back in the 40's and a couple in their mid 20's lived there and then the man go drafted to WWII and he never returned. The house was torn down in the mid 70's after it had been vacant for years after the woman died and made into a place of business at times you can see the lady sitting looking out the window waiting for her husband to return from war there has been times that 40's style swing music has been heard over the jukebox and no disc is playing and she has been seen moving around the building in a night gown and sometimes she will move dishes. - March 2007 Correction: The facts about the Pizza Hut are not accurate. It was the home of a TheShadowlands.net/ghosts visitor’s mother-in-law. She states the woman and her husband divorced and he moved to California. If it is her ghost, she would be waiting for her sons to come home, not a husband. The house was not vacant for any great length of time; at the most about a year. The visitor states she spent quite a few week ends in the house; was never afraid. One night something patted her and she thought it was her husband, however it was not. She and her husband figured it could have been the ghost of his younger brother who had died in the house. From what she had been told, he was a great kid and worried about the wildness of his older brother. He was only fifteen when cancer ended his life. Her husband's grand mother lived in the house prior to her death and she did like to re-arrange things. However, since this family loved the Lord, our visitor thinks no one at the Pizza Hut has anything to fear.

Sitka	United States	"A woman was struck and killed on the blind corner outside this well known watering hole in southeast Alaska. It used to be known as the Kik, or Kiksaadi club, but now it is Rookies, a sports bar. The story is that the woman left the bar and was extremely drunk. She tried to wander into town on her own, which was a common thing in this small town. Often, a cab could be flagged or someone who knew you would pick you up along the way. She staggered onto the road on the blind corner, and was literally run over by a young man who had been drinking as well, and driving a truck. She was so drunk that she actually got up, despite the terrible, traumatic wounds that she had received. She weaved about screaming and dying, not fully aware of what had happened to her. There were several witnesses to this tragedy since the bar was closing. Hundreds of people were aroun d, climbing into their vehicles and gathering for an, ""after hours"" party. It was a horrific scene. Since then, there have been stories of an apparition of the woman seen on that blind corner weaving in and out of the road. She supposedly has appeared to people who are driving under the influence of alcohol, prompting even brave men to park on the side of the road and flag a cab. Also, there are stories that in the early pre-dawn hours, terrible moans and death cries can be heard in the same area. The cries seem to be emanating from the bushes that are the cause of the corner being blind."

Anniston	United States	"The legend of Anniston High School's locker room is known widely throughout the school. The legend is told to all the new coming female freshmen that go to their lockers to change clothes for P.E. They are told by the upper classmen to give the freshmen a little scare by warning them of a vengeful ghost. The legend varies in detail from person to person but the main facts of the story are almost always the same… A girl is late getting changed and leaves a precious item behind. She decides to go back to get it while sending her friend to hold the bus for her. A man then tries to rape and kill her in the locker room but he ends up dead and the body never gets recovered. The obvious conclusion is never go into the girl's locker room by yourself. Always go in with one of your friends and never leave anyone alone in there. The true incident that started this legend occurred in 2001. This is what happened: There was this girl (name is unknown) who always changed for P.E. She was usually the first to change for P.E. and also the first to leave P.E. and change back. One day while coming in from playing outside, she was late in changing. It was the last period of the day and she was hurrying so that she wouldn't miss her bus. Her best friend was also late and they only had two minutes to change, instead of their normal five minutes. While they were hurrying to change, other girls who had already changed left to wait in the gym for the bell that signaled the end of the day to ring. Her friend was faster at putting on her school clothes but her friend stayed to wait with her in the locker room. They rode the same bus home, so they both knew that it was almost always one of the first buses to be there and didn't want to get left behind. So the girl finally finished putting on her clothes and they both walked out to sit with the rest of the students in the gym to wait for the bell. As the bell rang, the girl just remembered that she left her purse in her locker. She was concerned about leaving it because it contained all of her money. The girl's best friend offered to go back with her to get it, but the girl insisted that her friend should get on the bus and tell the bus driver to hold it for her until she got on. So the girl ran down the steps and entered the locker room to get her purse and her friend ran out to get on the bus. The friend relayed the message to the bus driver. As the girl got her purse and began to close her locker, she heard the door creak and thought someone had come in. Thinking it was her coach, she called her name and yelled, ""Coach! Coach! It's me, I left my purse. Please don't lock the door just yet."" She got no answer. She then heard footsteps that seemed to draw closer to her. She then began to grow scared. Suddenly, she heard breathing that was so loud she was sure the person w as right behind her. She panicked and dropped her purse. She ran the other way around the lockers toward the doors, but was yanked to the back of the lockers as she turned the corner. She kicked and screamed as the hands of a big strong man tore off her shirt and began to rip off the rest of her clothes. He began to strangle her and scream at her to shut up. She continued to fight back and tried to scream, but her throat closed and she couldn't scream anymore. She still didn't give up. In her last attempt, she pulled down a set of lockers on top of him. He laid there motionless and breathless... he was dead. In a fright, she ran out of the locker rooms to the bus stop. But she had taken too long and despite her friend’s desperate attempt to hold the bus, she had been left alone. She was still frightened by what had happened and called her mom to come and get her. After telling the shocking story to her mother with great trouble of reliving the incident, they called the polic e. But when they inspected the scene, they only found the pulled down lockers, the girl's purse and a pool of blood. The body was nowhere to be found. The girl was more shocked then ever. She was sure the man was dead and the amount of blood on the floor indicated that it was impossible for him to still be alive. Her fear was just too great to go back to where she had been raped and strangled, so they moved and were never heard from again. The man was never found, but many say that his ghost still lurks in the locker rooms waiting for an unsuspecting girl that's by herself to take his revenge. Many didn't take this seriously until a similar incident occurred when a girl in the band who was to play at a football game was left by herself to get dressed. The band left her in the locker room and played all night without noticing she was gone. After the game had ended, she was sitting in the parking lot crying. She wouldn't say what had happened, but appeared to have been strangl ed and her clothes were ripped and covered in blood. She then moved away without telling anyone of her dreadful story. Many girls have been known to hear footsteps drawing closer when no one's there, lockers close and shut, and the door creaks open as if to let in an unwanted stranger when no one is there. You might also feel a cold chill come over you and hear loud breathing coming from someone right behind you, but always cease when you turn around."

Jacksonville	United States	Dump Road is an unofficial name given to a section of the old Chief Ladiga Indian trail, located at the foothills of the Appalachian mountains. The modern name, “Dump Road” was given because of the trash dumped illegally up on the mountain by local people. This trail was traveled on by early settlers in the 1800's. The road is above the unmarked neighborhood called, “Brownwood Estates”. Originally, a paved section was completed going up the hill to the old road. It was supposed to be an expansion of the subdivision but was never completed in the 1980's. It hasn't been confirmed, but it’s rumored that the contractor responsible for developing the neighborhood had a bad experience on the old road, and never completed the subdivision. There are power poles set, but no lines. Since then, it is frequented by teens looking to park at night, camp, or for off-road vehicles. Many sightin gs during the day and night have included horses and wagons making their way along the old trail. Some people have claimed to see what appeared to be a black slave hanging from a tree above a clay embankment on the road, which is now used illegally as a shooting range. In the late 1980's, a couple that lived in the neighborhood below hiked into the mountain and discovered what was later found to be an old slave house near where a plantation burned in the early 1900's. Some reports from campers have claimed that while sleeping at night, they suddenly felt a very heavy presence and were woken by blood curdling screams in the forest. More reports suggest the sounds of screams and horses hurrying down the trail with an angry mob. Also reported are sightings of torches and lanterns bouncing around on the trail. It is believed that this is the event leading to the slave being hung. Residents in the neighborhood nearby have reported seeing a man walking up and down the street at ni ght, disappearing into the woods leading to the mountain.

Mobile	United States	"Located in Mobile Bay, the ship was brought to Mobile in 1964 as a tourist attraction and memorial for veterans in Alabama. The Alabama is a South Dakota class Battleship that was completed in 1942 for use in WWII. The ""Mighty A"" saw plenty of action against the Japanese in the south Pacific and is credited with shooting down 23 Japanese aircraft. Somehow, the Alabama and her crew managed to make it out of WWII without casualties or damage from enemy fire. The only deaths on board the ship were 8 people in a 5"" gun mount (mount #5) that were killed by friendly fire from another gun turret (mount #9) on the ship. A safety feature that prevented the turrets from firing if they were pointed at another turret or part of the ship failed. Mount 9 fired a round into mount 5 which exploded and killed everyone inside. All that remained of the gun commander was his boots. There we re little fragments of bone and flesh plastered on the walls inside the turret where the men were vaporized by the exploding shell. There were also two other deaths while the ship was under construction at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. A former worker reports that they had to stay on the ship overnight alone quite a bit, so they got their share of scares. Their first encounter was in the Marine Compartment where the Marines slept. Footsteps were heard approaching from around the corner when there was nobody on board. All around the ship, strange footsteps and voices were heard. Heavy solid steel watertight hatches on the superstructure would slam shut with a loud thud for reasons that could not be explained. Late at night when the whole ship was very quiet, the bulkheads would seemingly come alive with popping and tapping, and at times it was concentrated in one area. Needless to say, the Mighty A was very much alive."	USS Alabama Battleship	Alabama	AL	-88.0144261	30.6818034	-88.0398912	30.6953657	1964-01-01		1964-01-01	1964.0	1964.0	True		False	True

On the opposite bank was just about 20 feet then the tunnel itself. On the other side of the tunnel was a turn in the track. It was near midnight so the story goes when the signalman was waving the lantern to warn of danger. He knew it was of little use because of the layout of the track and tunnel before the trestle.

Urban Legend #2- While on the football field, located somewhere further up the hill, one is supposed to say out loud ""Buckeye, I challenge you to a race!"" A wind blows in, then either a mist arises or a pair of glowing, red eyes appear at one end of the field. A voice is heard saying, ""Run to the other end of the field or die!""

New Monmauth	United States	During the Revolutionary War the woods that once stood where now stands a housing sub-division, with the street name of Shelly Drive, provided cover and refuge to many troops of both sides of the American conflict. It has long been said that where the street Shelly Drive ends into a new sub-division there was a horrible battle between Patriots and British troops. So Bloody and horrific was this Battle that scores of troops from both sides were killed. One particularly poor soul was that of a boy named William Champlain who fought on the side of the Patriots but was a spy for the British. When it was discovered by Washington's troops that Champlain was a spy they did not let on to him that he was compromised. At the start of the battle it was relayed to the troops by Washington himself that Champlain should be shot from behind to let the British know that his traitorous dealings didn't deserve a bullet from the firing squad. Upon the start of the Battle Champlain moved to the front of the line to get a better shot he was heard to say, and before the first volley of shots were exchanged between side's he was dropped in his stride from a volley of shot's from five patriot's. It has long been said that the spirit of William Champlain Haunt's the sub-division in search of Washington in the hopes of finding out why he was struck down by his own troops. Being only a boy of 17 at the time of his demise and fond of the flute he has been heard many a fall night playing sad ballads and tunes in search of his mentor. So if you are walking or driving down Shelly Drive one evening and see a young lad dressed in Colonial attire don't be alarmed it is only William Champlain looking for his troops bivouac, and the reason for his betrayal.

Washington	United States	This cemetery is kind of large and extends on both sides of a small street off RT. 57 in Washington. In the smaller side of the cemetery there are 3 large headstones (possible the largest in that section). It was a husband, a wife and child, and a family friend. They were all murdered together in the family's house in the 1840's. If you read the epitaph on the headstones it mentions something about the wrath of God coming down upon those who did the murders. (the words are very warn and hard to read). This event was known as the Changewater Murders. Apparently the wrong people were caught and hung for the crime and by the time authorities figured out who really committed the murders, they were long gone. Orbs have been seen and caught on film.

Encampment	United States	"There is an area between Encampment and the old mining ghost town of Battle known as Slaughterhouse Gulch. An explosion in a mine near the area killed a miner. There wasn't enough of him left to bury properly. So it was said he walked and roamed through Slaughterhouse Gulch. Dorothy Peryam and her first husband, Horace Quivey, her brother John and his wife, Eda, were camped in the area in 1918. The men were marking timber there for the Forestry Service. It was dusk and they had made their campfire. Dorothy and John were standing close to the road when they heard a hollow cough and looked up to see a man walking down the road toward them. He walked past them, not looking to the right or left, or at them. They could not hear his footsteps as he walked by. It was very peculiar in those days for a stranger to be alone in the mountains at dark without a horse or supplies. He would have approached the fire to talk. But this person acted as though they weren't there. Charles M. Scribner ran a stage line between Battle and Encampment. One of his drivers quit because on one occasion a man approached his team of six horses, walked right between them and disappeared. The horses reared and bolted and it was all the driver could do to control them. He was sure it was the ""Ghost of Slaughterhouse Gulch."""

Ashland	United States	"It is said that during some early renovation work on the Paramount Theatre, a death occurred there and the man’s ghost has forever since haunted the Paramount. In the early 1940s, four construction workers from Boyd Theater Company in Cincinnati, Ohio were working on a project inside the auditorium. It is reported that all of them had gone to lunch except one man, a guy named Joe. When the other three returned, they found Joe hanging from the curtain rigging, dead. And since then, sounds have been heard, things have gone missing, cold drafts have been felt, and some folks even claim to have seen the image of a man appear on occasion. However, he is by all means a “good ghost” - one who seems to look out for the benefit of the theatre and its occupants. When Billy Ray Cyrus was here filming his video for ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" he was told about the legend of Paramount Joe. Between breaks, Billy Ray would talk to Joe, laughing and joking with him, sometimes even asking for his help. It is customary to get 8 x 10 photographs signed by each performer that appears at the Paramount and then hang the photo on the 'Wall of Fame' in the box office. Billy Ray personally autographed large color posters to each of the female employees working here at the time - and one with a personal inscription to Paramount Joe, whom he now had a fondness for. Each lady put her poster near her desk and Joe's was hung in the box office, near all the other performers. As time passed and the walls in the box office became too full of 8x10’s signed by other performers, the executive director felt that some of the pictures and posters needed to come down. Since there were so many of Billy Ray, she asked the women to remove their posters since they were all so similar. Nobody wanted to take their personally autographed picture of Billy Ray down so they took down the one he had signed to Paramount Joe. The next day, when the ladies came to work, every single 8x10 and poster that had been hanging neatly on the walls the night before were now lined strewn on the floor, many of their glass frames shattered! It was as if someone had wiped each one off the wall. To this day, Paramount Joe’s poster still hangs in the Paramount, in a very special part of The Marquee Room, which is now the site of Paramount Joe’s Rising Star Café’. There is another story about the time two new employees wanted to investigate the basement in the Paramount and some old items that had been stored there. To reach the basement, you must go through a door that is located just inside the lounge outside the ladies restroom. This brings you to the top of the stairs. At the top of those stairs is a light switch that will light the first section of the stairwell. As you progress, there is a switch that will light each area in front of you. And, there is no partner switch. In other words, you must turn the light off at the same place you turned it on. The marketing director had offered to take the two new female employees into the basement and turned on the lights at the top of the stairs. The ladies hurried down the steps. At that moment the marketing director was called to take a phone call inside the office. He told the other two employees to wait, he would be right back. In their excitement however, they did not hear him and they continued on. Recounting the story later, it was at this point they called up to him to turn on the next light for them. As it turned out, he was on the phone longer than expected and met the ladies as they were coming back up the steps. ""Thanks for turning on the light for us,"" one of them said, ""but we can't get it to turn off."" Puzzled, he explained that he had not turned on the light for them – and in fact, could not turn on the light. The expression on their faces revealed that they were not kidding with him. They lead him back into the basement, only to be met by darkness. 'Someone' had turned the light off again as well. ""Well, thanks Joe,"" called out one of the ladies, as she shivered. In 2004, marketing director Tyson Compton was giving a tour to some high school students. As he was relating the Paramount Joe story, he realized that he was always talking about Joe, and not to him. So as he spoke to the students, he stopped and called out, “Joe, are you here? Is it ok that I tell your story?” While he swears that he then heard a seat squeak, that is not the the most chilling part of this story. Compton relates how he received a call the very next day from a psychic who lived in the area. She asked him if someone in his family or a close friend had recently died because she had gotten a message from “the other side.” He said no that he could think of no one. “Well, she said, “I’m supposed to tell you that Joe said he is here.”"	Paramount Art Center	Kentucky	KY	-82.6428131	38.4801198	-82.63793869999999	38.4784144	2004-01-01		2004-01-01	2004.0	2004.0	True		False	True

After the blood was cleaned up it reappeared the next day and to this day it can't be cleaned. The room upstairs in the house where the man committed suicide has been blocked off so that nobody can go in and see the horrible scene. The blood outside is still there and cannot be removed. It is said that the place is haunted to this very day by those troubled souls.

Jackson County	United States	The story is that 15 or 16 little kids got detention and were locked in the boiler room. The boiler exploded and killed the kids.

But when u look at the spots in person there is nothing, but in the pictures there is freaky stuff. On the walls in the boiler room there are child size handprints burned into the wall. -  November 2005 update: no screams where noted. A well-defined shadow of a little kid was seen through one of the glass doors in the school. The investigators watched this figure move from side to side of the door and then it walked toward them through the door and stood still for around 30 seconds, all of the sudden it bent down and got into like a 3 point lineman stance and then jumped toward them, they turned the lights on and there was nothing there. They placed a voice recorder in the boiler room as well and got what sounded to be a heartbeat that kept getting faster and louder and then made one loud beat and stopped. Also there was a loud moaning throughout the whole schoolhouse from the pipes but there is no heat going through the pipes so I have no clue why that would be making noise. An update to make on the school is that it was demolished last year and made into a park for the community.

Jamestown	United States	AKA Lydia's Bridge - Just outside of Greensboro, there has said to have been the ghost of a beautiful young girl who has been appearing near Greensboro since 1923. She stands next to the US Highway 70 Underpass in a white evening gown and waves frantically for someone to stop and pick her up. Those hapless travelers who do are introduced to a young woman who says her name is Lydia and she always ask them to please take her to an address in High Point. She always tells them that she has spent the evening at a dance in Raleigh and is anxious to get home, having run into car trouble on the way. Just as the drivers approach the house, the girl always vanishes from their car, never opening the door and getting out.-  March 2004 additional info: There are many versions to the story but the most common one that I have heard is that Lydia was at a dance one night and was trying to get home. A car apparently hit her and now she hitches rides home from the bridge. When the person gets her to her house, she disappears. She never says anything other than her name is Lydia; she needs to get home, and her address. Another story posted on www.dawghouse.topcities.com/northcarolina.html.  Either way, she died in 1923. The road that linked High Point and Greensboro was a different road than is there now. There are train tracks that are the reason for the bridge. The bridge now is called the graffiti bridge, for obvious reasons. To the left of this bridge, about 40 ft away and hidden in massive amounts of kudzu, is where the original bridge is, and it's Lydia's bridge. There is another bridge about 2 miles away from these that is also believed to be Lydia's bridge. This one is an actual bridge that you drive over and it's over a creek. Some kids have spray painted pentagrams on it which is kind of freaky but at the same time, there is a sort of eerie presence here. One report of a group of friends in the 80’s that would venture there had two girls in this group and every time they would get close to the bridge, the girls would pass out. www.hauntednc.com says that Lydia is merely an urban legend. Which bridge is really her bridge? How did she die? Why was she walking home? Or was she in the car with her date? Where’s a newspaper article or an obituary that can prove to us that this happened? If she died at the bridge close to the graffiti bridge, one wonders who is haunting the one over the creek? Why would kids choose that bridge to paint pentagrams on?

Laurinburg	United States	Just off of this road named Fox Crossing Road lies an old lumber road that winds through the woods. While it is no longer used, it was once used by logging trucks to cut timber down and haul it out. If you walk down this lumber road at nighttime, and look out into the woods, you can sometimes see a couple, dressed in 1920's style clothing. They are dancing, and the moon shines right on them. After about three seconds, they always disappear. The story is that they were a wealthy newly wed couple back in the 1920's, and they planned on building a mansion out in these woods, equipped with a giant ballroom for dancing. But they were both tragically killed just as construction of their mansion started. And now they say their spirits dance together forever, in where their ballroom would have once stood.

Monroe	United States	"The old Blakney House is located on Franklin St. Believed to be haunted by William Blakney, a greedy miser who has hidden his fortune somewhere in the house. There is also rumored talk about a girl, perhaps related to Blakney, who watched her parents get run over from the upstairs window. The house was first renovated and remodeled about 15 years ago to house a privately owned ""Boswell's Restaurant."" Prior to the remodeling, neighborhood kids were told not to go around the house, but that might have been just adults against trespassing. Once the restaurant opened, employees began to report strange things, such as dishes (entire cabinets full) relocated, tables being moved, and other odd anomalies. One account, involved a luncheon on the 2nd floor in one of the reserve rooms. Only two people were at the restaurant (it didn't open until lunch) and they set up elaborate place settings for the luncheon. As they went downstairs to start preparing further, loud crashes and bangs were heard from the upstairs. Using the slave staircase (it's that old), which is the only way to get up to that part of the house when it's locked, they found the entire banquet room had been ransacked. When you try to go upstairs, you get a very unsettling feeling - the feeling of ""I don't want to go up there at all."" No business, restaurant or otherwise, has been successful at the Blakney house, or at least no business ever stays there for very long. The business located there today makes a point of closing before dark, as they are afraid to be in the building for ""when the fun begins."""

Marion	United States	"Witches Grave - This cemetery is located off of Ford's Ferry Road in Marion. The legend behind this cemetery is about a five year old girl who was burned at the stake, along with her mother, in the late 1800's to the early 1900's for witchcraft. It is not known what happened to the body of the mother, however the little girl, Mary Evelyn, is buried in a steel lined grave that is covered with rock and not dirt. She has a white picket fence surrounding her grave. The base of this fence is a series of crosses that connect end to end. However she is not tall enough to climb over the fence, unlike a normal 5 year old. Her tombstone looks brand new even though it is close to 100 years old, as does the fence. She paces inside this fence when someone comes to visit her making faces at them and reaching out to them. She sleeps during the day but is very evident at night. The legend also says that she can not rest because she is searching for her mother but can not escape the confines of the fence. Many unexplainable things occur at this cemetery. For one the ""Watcher"" makes himself very know and tries to follow you out of the cemetery. The ""Watcher"" was murdered at the swinging bridge but haunts the witch’s grave. He is trying to get to the little witch but because of the crosses that surround her he is unable to because he is evil. Crosses appear in the trees both upright and upside down, directly over her grave, though they face different directions. She presents herself as a normal 5-year-old little girl in a white dress, though her dress is scorched at the bottom as is her blonde hair. If you lay on her grave she will hold you down refusing to let go until someone from outside of the fence pulls you free. However never lay on the grave when you are alone because chances are you will be pulled into her grave to be with her thus giving her more power. As with every haunted cemetery people that are open to the spirit world sees something different."

Owenton	United States	Here there is a pre civil war plantation that burnt down and killed 2 kids and there nanny. It was rebuilt and later turned into a private country club in 1967. The house was made into the restaurant and the rooms upstairs were rented out (to live in) then redone into a bed and breakfast (just for members guests). If you listen hard you can always hear little kids screaming and running footsteps all around. Doors won’t unlock and open or sometimes they won’t open even if unlocked. The nanny keeps quiet but every once in a while someone will get the privilege to see her full body in big windows that start at your nose. Since then the country club has been turned into a resort where they have built a hotel and made the golf course public. The ghosts do not like this, the fire alarms go off in the middle of the night for no reason and even after being reset will go off again. Curtains shut themselves and in the kitchen pots and pans will bang together and the doors will shut and lock themselves.

Park City	United States	A spirit of the cave is a Southern lady named Melissa, who brought her Yankee lover to the cave in 1843. She took the man deep within the cave to Purgatory Point and left him there as a prank. The man was never seen again, and Melissa's ghost still searches the area known as Echo River. The ghost of Floyd Collins, who died after being trapped for sixteen days in nearby Crystal Cave, is also said to wander the grounds. The case became so popular that in 1926, Collins's body was removed from his family plot and displayed in a glass coffin at the entrance to Crystal Cave. The grisly tourist attraction proved very profitable, until someone stole the corpse. It was finally returned to the cave; however, for some reason the body was missing its left leg. In recent years, tourists have reported the unidentified ghost of a man dressed in an old-fashioned cummerbund.

Partridge	United States	late at night you can here a loud whaling and screaming coming from the woods on Lewis creek. No one knows exactly what happened but their used to be a racetrack that everyone used to race cars on. It wasn’t pro or anything but it was fun for the guys mostly and their girlfriends would come to watch then race and one time there was a horrible accident and a car wrecked and went into the bleachers and killed more than 15 people and it is believed that the screams are from all the people that died that day. the track is still up there and the guard rails and what’s left of the bleachers is their too. the old buildings that the cars where sometimes kept in are still their too. Kids go up there and use it for paint ball games. People who live behind the area have experienced their roll up shades moving own their own, hearing voices whispering like at night. - June 2008 correction / additional information: The racetrack was known as Lonnie's Speedway and yes it's still there, not in good shape but still there. There was an accident that only the drivers were killed in, not 15 people. Every now and then, no certain time, you can sit on the blacktop road that runs beside the earth walls of the track and hear the wreck happen. There are no homes behind the track, it's all woods. There are houses on the creek past the track, as well as before you get to the track. If you want to find this track I'll tell you how. You go up Lewis Creek, off of US HWY 119 in Partridge. Cross the new state bridge just off 119, then go on up the holler. You'll cross a set of railroad tracks on your way to the track. You will come to a yard with a fairly large house off in the distance and an old barn just off the road; this is Lonnie Lewis' house, and barn. The Lonnie that lives in the house is also the Lonnie that the speedway was named after. The racetrack looks like just a hill, just off the road right past the barn on the left of the road. Make sure ask Lonnie's permission to go to the actual track because he is now old and might think that you're trying to steal something. His son also lives in a camper near the track, behind the barn.	Lewis Creek	Kentucky	KY	-82.9004223	37.0051826	-82.8979391	37.00648320000001	2008-01-01		2008-01-01	2008.0	2008.0	True		False	True

Perry County	United States	Tunnel Hill - Tunnel Hill is located a couple of miles in the back roads of Napfor just before you get to low water bridge. Directly on top of the twin tunnels lie two cemeteries. But forget about the cemeteries for the tunnels are the sites of many bizarre occurrences. The story has it that there is a hidden chamber hidden among the manholes. It is said that the manhole will give way to the secret passage and those who have ventured into this passage have no recollection of how they got there. When walking through the tunnels all light sources will slowly drain and the further you venture into the tunnel total darkness. It is then that random light sources will appear from cracks and crevices on various places in the tunnel. Rather you go in the day or night the same will happen because most occurrences happen once you reach the middle of the tunnel. The right tunnel is much more active than the left. NEVER go alone. Beware these tunnels are still in service and actual trains still pass through each day. One such aspect of the haunting place is the ghost train, which you will actually hear and even feel beneath your feet. Faint train horns echo throughout this terrifying area. Also feel free to explore the large active cemeteries above. Rumors are there many more horrifying things that have happened and continue to happen that cannot be mentioned in this article. - July 2005 Update/Warning: This may not be a safe place to visit. There reports of people being chased out of the tunnels by something unexplained. This can lead to injury or worse.

Richmond	United States	"The Civil War emancipationist, Cassius M. Clay, one of his daughters, one of his sons, and a black servant, haunt the mansion. There have been sightings of Master Clay passing back and forth in front of the top middle window (the nursery), waiting for his ex-wife and children to return. -  June 2005 Update: The Curator at White Hall State Historic Site reports: It is possible that a daughter and son are at White Hall, as numerous incidents site a woman and a little boy. A baby most certainly resides in the mansion. On two separate occasions, in two different seasons, tour guides have heard a baby laughing. Another guide had a small child on her tour remark about seeing babies in the house. The story of Clay passing before the ""top middle window"" (which, incidentally is the third floor hallway, and not a nursery) is a story that the works say they never heard of or experienced at this site. It is doubtful that Cassius would have waited for his ex-wife and children, more likely they would be waiting for him, as he spent a great deal of time away from home campaigning, fighting in the Mexican War, as ambassador to Russia, and in general making a spectacle of himself. In addition to sightings of a lady (although we call her ""the lady in black,"" she is rather stylish and tends to change her clothes, the Curator’s husband has seen her in blue), music has been heard in the mansion (of the piano and music box variety) as well as footsteps.

Other times she is there and disappears. Doors close and open, TV’s and stereos come on and off, radios and computers turn on. Padlocked doors are opened and then when you walk back by (minutes later) it will be locked. Some days it is locked and you can see lights from underneath the door leading up to the attic. It is rumored that she was a cheerleader who got pregnant by a football player and instead of leaving school (strict place here) she killed herself in the attic. She supposedly lived on the third floor in 316. One girl who lived in that room was engaged and at night she would take her ring off and put it on the desk and every morning she would wake up to find it in the garbage.

Winchester	United States	There is a former medical clinic turned museum in downtown Winchester, Kentucky that seems to be haunted. The stories range from footsteps around, and above the listener to doors opening and closing themselves, and even sightings of full body apparitions of former clinic employees. Moving cold spots, fluctuating EMF readings, various orb photos, and such are common in the building especially on the third floor. There have been several very clear EVPs caught in and around the former operating room, and in various places on the third floor of the building, as well as in the former morgue area. The voices captured seem to be that of doctor and nurses talking just before, or during a surgery, and of a man screaming, and moaning in pain. Also, at least one home video exists of heavy footsteps walking, and then running across the floor above the listeners, and of a hallway door shutting itself, opening itself, and then slamming its self shut. The most compelling evidence this video holds is of a lock on the third floor hallway door unexplainably unlatching its self right before your eyes, and the door slowly opening. These events have been witnessed for decades, and by countless numbers of people and as before stated even exists on video. The building is currently open  as a museum for historical tours Tuesday thru Friday for a small admission fee, and plans are in the works to do a half night paranormal tour for Halloween 2008.

Hays	United States	There was a story that said a girl went to a party at Swinging Bridge Park. She got drunk, and she wanted to go home. Her boyfriend offered to take her home, but she refused. She said that she would walk home. When crossing the highway, she was hit by a car and she died. One boy and his friend were biking down the old bike trail that is now shut down. The first time around, they were riding in tall grass, and they caught a glimpse of a pale girl walking in the grass right in front of them. One of the boys swerved to miss her. They turned and looked back, and saw nothing. They went around the trail once more and looked where they almost hit the girl. They didn't see anything. Where she was walking in the tall grass, no evidence was left - no footprints or broken grass. Stumped, the boys kept biking and then suddenly came to a stop. What they saw in frontof them was that same girl in the torn shirt wearing shorts sitting on a high tree branch. The branch was a flimsy branch and it's obvious it wouldn't be able to support more than about maybe 10 pounds. Yet stumped again, the boys took another trip around the trail and saw nothing.

Lawrence	United States	Haskell is a know sight for countless paranormal activity. The campus itself dates back to the 1800's when the US Government built Haskell Institute to help control the Native American population and assimilate them into mainstream America. Native American children were taken from their reservations and sent to schools like Haskell to teach them how to be white Americans. All aspects of their Native American heritage was stripped from them and they were forced to act as the Government felt appropriate. Countless reports and documents held in the National Archives office in Kansas City tell stories of children beaten and abused for using their Native tongue, or for acting out of conduct. The University of Kansas forensic labs hold several remains of children found buried throughout the Haskell Campus. Many rumors are speculated about some of the Universities buildings, which are all some of the oldest in the state of Kansas. Haskell is an amazing place for those who seek an up and close experience with the paranormal. The history and horror that this campus holds is unlike any other place in the world. So, if you are daring, ask for a key to Hiawatha Hall and see if you can stand to be alone in the building for more than one evening.

Parsons	United States	"An explosion in the late 1980s killed two workers, a man and a woman, and closed the plant for more than two years. When work resumed in 1990, just in time for the Persian Gulf War, part of the building was closed. To prevent sympathetic detonation in case of an accident, work areas were located several hundred yards apart, connected by ramshackle, unpainted, wasp-infested wooden ramps. Inspectors, supervisors and parts managers rode old-fashioned bicycles with wire handlebar baskets between areas. They used thumb-operated bicycle bells to alert other bikers and ""pedestrians"" before crossing an intersection or entering an adjoining hallway. As production of the cluster bombs continued -- with 202 bombs tucked inside each one -- rumors spread that the workers killed by a single exploding bomblet was haunting the closed area of the plant. Only two of the employees who survived the explosion returned to the plant, but they each began to have nightmares about their former co-worker; one was being chased through the dark, wooden ramps by the woman, whose face was destroyed in the blast by flying shrapnel. The other survivor was plagued by visions of a male co-worker being vaporized from the waist up by the explosion, his legs, shielded by the thick steel work table, beginning to turn and run without its upper body. In the dreams, they kept running. Finally, one night two inspectors and a parts manager decided to explore the closed ramp. There were no lights in the area, and the workers hadn't thought to bring a flashlight. Still, they crept ahead into the dark. About 100 feet or so up the hall, the air cooled noticeably. The men walked a few feet further until, from around a bend ahead of them, they heard it: a metallic ringing. A bicycle bell rang twice in the pitch black, abandoned hall. Brrrng, brrrng! Then, after a pause, twice more: Brrrng, brrrng! The men, already nervous because of the dark and cold, fled back down the ramp to the light. After catching their breath, they agreed they had heard a bicycle bell, precisely the type bell used by the company's supervisors, inspectors, etc. for transportation in the labyrinthine plant. They agreed that the sound had come from ahead of them, not behind, and they agreed it wasn't likely anyone could have been in the ramp ahead of them with a bicycle."

Brewster	United States	"There are several, seemingly, unrelated stories about this road which starts as Federal Hill Road in Brewster, New York and ends as Joe's Hill Road in Danbury, Connecticut. The most pronounced story is that of the Jesus Tree (cut down in the early 1990's). This tree with the image of Jesus on the crucifix was said to ""bleed"" a red substance from its trunk when they cut it down. There are twelve trees evenly spaced and equal in stature directly following where the Jesus Tree stood. These are said to be the twelve apostles. When you travel farther down the road (eastbound), you come to a very curious looking estate. this ominous looking estate is actually Morefar Golf Club. This is believed to be a cover for something else. Word of links to the Satanic church have been bantered about. The main entrance has a sign reading ""Back 'o Beyond"". Interesting welcome for a country club. Immediately following Morefar, and across the street is Farrington Pond. There have been several stories about people driving off the road, into the pond, claiming to have seen ""something"". The undifinitive story of this pond is that a young lady, on her way to a High School Prom, went off the road and into the pond. She was said to have drowned. When the moonlight hits the water, people have been known to see an image in a prom dress on top of the water, dancing - alone. In 1988, a young man named Dean, was found in his car on the side of the pond (just off the road), dead from gun shot wounds to the back of his head. The two men who were responsible were captured within a week. It is unknown whether this has anything to do with the spirit of the pond, but, if nothing else, it adds to the eeriness of the road."

Another staff member swore she was touched on the shoulder while cleaning a classroom, only to turn around and find no one. She also said she was cleaning one of the ballet rooms and, slipping from her stepladder and falling backwards, was caught by an unknown force and set down gently, unharmed.

Bronx	United States	In the fields at the edge of this small beach town, stands an old abandoned farmhouse overlooking the water. People say that a large mansion once accompanied the farmhouse. The residents of the mansion were very wealthy and many people were jealous of them. One man went to the extreme and caught their house on fire. The entire house was destroyed, but the family was able to escape to the farmhouse in time. The police came to investigate, but feared the people of Silver Beach would move if they heard about the arson. The police simply said that there was a tragic fire and the family had died. They even went as far as to say the field could be used for children to play. The suspect was never found, and the family continued to live secretly in the farmhouse. In 1950, ten years after the fire, the suspect who set the fire returned. He murdered the entire family the night before Halloween by stabbing them to death. The next evening, a group of teenagers came to the field to hang out. The young daughter, who had been able to escape the murderer, was going crazy looking for her family. The teens watched in horror as she ran to the water and dived in. She drowned instantly, since she was unable to swim. They reported the incident to the police. They searched everywhere but the girl was never found. The only description the teenagers could give of the girl was that she had strawberry colored hair. Every Halloween since the incident, the girl's ghost can be seen frantically searching for her family and the murderer.

Both boys were arrested and convicted for killing the firefighter. Not long after, people reported seeing a glowing figure running along the track. Others have seen the body of a man laying on the track then dissappearing, all in the same spot he was shot, the northeast corner of lane 5.

Long Island	United States	Mary's Grave - She murdered her two children and her husband. Her gravesite is a center for strange happenings. Her marker has her birth date but no death date. - December 2003 Update: There is a different variation on that story that seems to be the most heard of around there. Supposedly Mary was the daughter of a rich land owner that owned that area and formed the town there. He was a loner and built his house way out from the town. He also had a son. She had no friends and her father built her a stone club house on the property for her to play. She liked animals and wuld play with them in her stone clubhouse. Supposedly she was possessed by a spirit and started mutilating the animals on a stone table in her clubhouse. Later on she killed her father and her brother with an axe. After the some time the townspeople went to see what had happened the the land owner and found her sleeping in her fathers bed with him covered in blood. They hung her on a tree on the property. The tree is there on the side of the road. It always looks dead all year long. The burn marks from her rope are on the tree branch. Up the hill is the house. You can see a figure sitting in the window looking down on the road. Now that part of the house is supposed to be blocked off. Her stone clubhouse is on the road just a bit further up. The way it went was back in the 60's and 70's you were the big tough guy if you went up to Mary's grave and urinated on it. They say whoever did would get into a car accident on the way back swerving to avoid hitting a girl in a white dress. The gravesite has been lost or nobody really remembers where it is, but all the other things are there.

A witness attempted to confront the ghost by running after him, but as he turned the corner, the ghostly man vanished. The man is described about 5ft, dress in a dark suit style in 1800 with top hot. You could hear his footstep as he walks back and forth on the second floor. The basement is truly a frightening experience. Every time we went down stars the temperature dropped at least 15 degrees. EMF went wild, as you get closer to the fireplace. As the hairs on the back of my neck reacted to chills, you can actually feel ghostly pressure surrounding you. The sounds of Ghostly footsteps wondering around have become a common occurrence at this inn. This house is truly haunted.

Newburgh	United States	"The story goes... There is a rather large building, in which is now know Plum Point condo's, in Newburgh NY that used to be a all boys Christian school. One of the nun's molested the boy & killed him then put his body in the wall and covered it up well (being there was already construction going on inside it was a good cover-up, he was just reported missing) Then about a year later strange things would happen that drove the school to shut down. For about 10 or more years now they have been trying to make it into an apartment complex because there are condo's all around it, and every time someone goes in there to work, a hand was cut off by machinery, the machinery would break for no apparent reason, etc.. And many people have said they have seen the boy. - October 2005 Correction: The above submission is the ""popular word about town"" regarding the information on our site, however, most of it is not true. Unfortunately, this same description regarding Plum Point on many websites. Probably cutting and pasting from this site. A visitor to our site reports the following: ""Before the condos went in, there was a large mansion (complete with detached servant's quarters.) It was originally constructed for a family who met an untimely death. The mansion then became a home for wayward girls for many years and eventually an orphanage of sorts, accepting children who were not only parentless, but had no where to run. This is where the rumors of the molestation occurrence sprouts from. The molestation may be true, but in all my research and hearing of rumors, I have never heard a report of anyone being buried in the walls."

The entire building has a heavy sort of a feeling to it, but it is the basement in particular that makes all who step down there to visit the restroom uneasy. Some librarians working there would not go down to the basement to the restroom the entire time they worked there because of the uncomfortable feeling that overwhelms visitors to the basement.

Ozone Park	United States	The Jewish cemetery is over a century old, and has hardly been taken care of. Though many have passed it on the A train, at Boyd ave. It has ben vandalized so often that the caretakers are forced to close it down at 4 PM. The graveyard is a group of 3 cemeteries. If you walk in it you will come across many graves with pictures of who occupies the tomb. As well as a few un-earth graves. One part is almost sectioned off, where only infants and children remain, with there tombstones almost completely sucked into the ground. The trees for some reason also grow in twisted formations that even you imagination can't muster a image. At night you feel like you are being watched. Reports of cries, talking, laugher and an ominous fog loom over the site. As well as faces and orbs appearing in pictures. And sites of gray images sitting on the tomb stones. But who says its safe during the day? At all hours you feel you are being watched. As well as many who have reported stomach pains near the location. While you walk, you feel like something is standing next to you or running past your eyes. And once in a while you get an over whelming stench, that brings tears to you eyes. Prey you don't go and vandalize the already damaged graves, who knows how much more those poor souls can take.

Oyster Bay	United States	The home was originally owned by the Townsend family. The house was used as a base for the British during the Revolutionary War. John Andre was a British Major during the war and visited often. One day Townsend's daughter overheard Andre and John Simcoe (Commander of British Forces) talking about a payment to Benedict Arnold to surrender his troops. The Townsends relayed this information to George Washington. Benedict Arnold escaped, but Andre was captured and hanged. His ghost was first reported here in the 1930s when he was seen on horseback outside a bedroom window. John Andre isn't the only ghost here. Sally Townsend, allegedly John Simcoe's lover is said to still haunt the house. Her former bedroom is always cold, even in the summer the curator wears a warm wool vest in that room! Paranormal investigators have said that whatever is in that room is not happy. In October of 1999 a volunteer was working on the property when the garden door opened and a man came out wearing a dark wool coat with brass buttons. First it was strange to see someone wearing that clothing, second the building was locked, and third the alarms were all on! In march another worker saw the same ghost materialize by the staircase. Once with the bottom half of his body missing, and then again full-figure. The ghost is believed to be Michael Conlin, an Irish immigrant who worked as a servant in the 1860's. In the upstairs of the former servants quarters moving shadows have been seen when no one else is in the house. In that same area the smell of roses has mysteriously been sensed. The spirit of a servant woman has materialized and walked into the kitchen. In that kitchen the smell of apple pie has also been present when ghosts want to make themselves known. The submitter was extremely privileged when they smelled the strong scent of cinnamon-apple on their way down the stairs near the kitchen. When they got down to the bottom of the stairs they could smell the strong scent of something like cinnamon rolls or apple pie! Another area that is said to produce some interesting smells is the front foyer. The smell of a non-existent stove has been sensed there as well as the faint smell of a smoking pipe. At one time this was the kitchen area. The former museum director Andrew Batten says he has sensed at least 5 different entities and something in Sally Townsend's room.

Poughkeepsie	United States	The ghost of former Rector, Dr. Alexander Griswold Cummings has been reported here many times since his death in the late 1940s or early 50s. While he was still living, he did not like using candles, so candles used during services were repeatedly blown out. At one point, a bat materialized in the church, then disappeared. In the 1970s, Bishop James Pike, Rector at the time, scared the ghost away from the sanctuary by bringing his dog into the church. After that, Alexander remained quiet for a while. In the 1990s, Alexander surfaced again. This time, it was because current Rector, the Rev. Michael Phillips, decided to move the Rector's office to a different location in the building. The move outraged the ghost, and for years afterwards, the old rector's office (now the library) would be freezing cold in the mornings, even during the spring. Eventually, the ghost went back into hiding. Another ghost is the spirit of an elderly lady, who died in the middle of a service sometime in the 1910s. Her ghost has been seen sitting in a pew halfway back, and many who sit halfway back in darkness in the evening and night feel a strange presence, even if there appears to be nothing there.

Merrill	United States	In the 1850's white lumbermen were welcomed by the Indians and their chief. Some time later his daughter Jenny, for whom the settlement was named for died. On how she died is speculation. One account says she fell in love with one of the lumberman, became pregnant and killed herself. Another is, she died during child birth. Another is she died from flu brought by the white man. The chief buried her on the hill, and cursed the ground that it would never do any white man any good. The curse is the legend. Nine people died after T.B. Scott bought the land for a home in 1884 and died unexpectedly in 1886 before the house was finished. Within a year his wife Ann died. Their son Walter went to see the architect to finish the house. He was stabbed to death by him. In 1893 it was sold to a man named Kuechle. He lost all his money on a gold mine and mortgaged the house to Tony Barsanti. Tony foreclosed and Kuechle went insane and died in an asylum. The same year Barsanti was stabbed to death in Chicago while waiting for a train to Merrill. In 1901, George Gibson bought the house and went to inspect it. He was never seen again. In 1906, Mary Fellhaber bought the property. Soon after fell ill and died. Popcorn Dan was the caretaker and died in 1912 after booking passage on the Titanic.The next caretaker Mr. Lloydsen died of alcoholism. In 1919 the widower of M. Fellhaber gave the property to the city. In 1923 the city gave it to the Sisters of the Holy Cross who have seemed to break the curse for now. Rumors of ghost sightings in the tower.

Before her lover got there she was raped and murdered.  Because of the horrible way that she was murdered she could not be buried in the cemetery so they buried her where they found her body.  on the night of a full moon if you pulled up by her grave stone you could see her standing on the road side. They have since opened the road and her gravestone can no longer be found. However, when you drive a certain point of new highway, you can hear screams.

Cedar Falls	United States	"Lawther Hall  -  Was believed to be haunted by the spirit of a soldier named Augie, who died there when the building was being used as an infirmary. Students in this residential hall have reported strange noises, cold spots, and movement of objects. Lawther Hall has always been a women's dorm, and at no time was it ever used as an infirmary. During the war it was used partially as a dormitory for WAVES- definitely not men. In fact, the stories told of Augie center largely around the fifth (or perhaps fourth) floor attic areas. These were never used as rooms, but were originally recreational areas for the women in the dorm. In the early 70's, these rooms were closed (1972, I believe) because they were deemed in disrepair and quite unsafe. For a few years, a hall Halloween Haunted House called ""Augie's Attic"" was held there until a fire started accidentally one year, and the activity was banned. In fact, to say that Lawther is the dorm that is primarily haunted could be entirely incorrect. Next door to Lawther, in fact attached to, is Bartlett Hall.

Estherville	United States	its a cemetery and there is this hill that is haunted. The story is that a car full of football players were going to their game and their car stalled on this very hill. So they all got out and started to push the car up this hill then a car came around this bend and didn?t see the football players and hit them. All of the players died. People say that if you put your car in neutral between these 2 markers you will go uphill because the football players push you up the hill because they don?t want you to get hit by another car. Another story is that two children who lived in the nearby mansion were playing in the road when they were run over and killed. When your car moves, it is the children pushing it off of them. Anyway, the going up hill sensation is caused by an optical illusion. For this to work, you must be headed downhill. In the place where you stop, the road levels off and appears to go up in comparison to the rest of the road. If you go down the hill and around the curve and look back, you will realize that the entire road does indeed go down hill.

Mount Ayr	United States	Tedrow is a small cemetery in the country. In the daytime, there is a tree that contains an evil face. But at night, the spirits frequently make themselves known. It is not the cemetery but it is the woods that surrounds the cemetery that is haunted. Apparently about fifty to a hundred years ago, a small cult came the cemetery and did ceremonies. Now whenever you drive at night into the cemetery, you may enter but you may not be able to get out. The reason for this is because there is a glowing object in the woods and if this glowing object gets too close to you, you will not be able to start your car. But in order to witness the strange happenings you need to have your car turned off and lights turned off. You can have a flashlight with you but that is it. While you are in complete silence and complete darkness, something might run passed you several times and when you look nothing will be there. Sometimes you might hear moaning in the woods, sometimes you will hear what sounds like somebody pounding a metal sheet against a tree. Sometimes you will see a dark figure staring at you from a tree. And if you are really lucky, you will witness the strangest and scariest experience that you ever had. At times you might wait for a good five or ten minutes and nothing will seem to happen, but when you have given up all hope and decide to leave, all at once there will sound like a herd of elephants are all around you and make the loudest racket. You are guaranteed to jump in your car and take off, but that is just the beginning. If you leave your window open, while your driving, you will hear the object following you until you have reached the end of the pathway leading to the cemetery. Also the weather is completely different there, it could be a hot day and when you reach the cemetery, it will be cold. And it could be the clearest day and when you reach the cemetery it will begin to rain. And there could be no wind at all and when you reach the cemetery there will be ten to twenty mile an hour winds. - Fair WARNING ? As with all other haunted places, you need to get permission before going in to a cemetery late at night. There may be NO TRESPASSING and you could be fined. Be smart and be safe, do it the legal way.	Tedrow	Iowa	IA	-94.1260303	40.6714079	-94.235232	40.7147147	2025-05-26		2025-05-26		1907	False	1907	True	True

Muscatine	United States	The Blue Angel - is a statue in the Greenwood Cemetery who used to hold a rose and if the person looking at the angel, if she dropped the rose, you were doomed to death. Eventually some people cut off her hand so that she wouldn't be able to hurt anyone anymore, but at night time her hand was still there, glowing in the night holding the rose that she might drop on you. When approaching the angel you will see the sky turn blood red and when you look at the trees cause the angel is set back all by itself in a cove, the short side of the trees will be swaying and the tall side will not. - March 2007 Background Information: The Blue Angel is made of an ebony white gypsum. In the sides of the mausoleum in which she is housed are two cobalt blue stained glass windows. One to the east and one to the west. Each morning as the new dawn emerges and each night as the day ends the sun shines thru the windows bathing her in a luminescent glow turning her white figure blue. During the 50's stories of the blue angel were all of a benevolent nature. She was the protector, the guardian angel of the cemetery, protecting all within from any vandals or wrong doers. It is very sad the current stories of any evil associated with her.

Rockwell City	United States	"In the education building which is one of the oldest buildings on grounds and is said to have previously been the hospital, there have been sightings of a female walking on the lower level, screams, and doors opening and closing. The prison itself was a female prison prior to 1982, and has its own graveyard for several female inmates that passed away while in custody. - October 2007 Update/ Additional Information: It was previously used for different things; an infirmary, and solitary confinement. Many people have claimed to have had experiences there. Nothing too concrete. The prison itself was a female reformatory opening in the early 1900s. Many of the old buildings are extremely creepy, and many odd sounds are heard. Most can be attributed to old pipes, but once in a while, the hair does go up on the back of one's neck. The cemetery contains graves of women and babies, presumably that died during childbirth. What really adds to the ""haunted"" feeling is the giant old twisted oak trees that surround the older buildings."

Sioux City	United States	"The building was originally built around 1915 as a state-of-the-art meat packing plant. However, shortly after it was built the company went bankrupt. It was later purchased by Swift and Co. who operated a packing operation in it for many years. In 1949, however, a gas leak caused an explosion that killed a number of people. Later after Swift moved out it was purchased and made into a shopping center that included store shops, a bowling alley and miniature golf course. A friend that worked as security and also operated a martial arts studio in the building reported a number of strange happenings. There at one time was a terrace that was had lights that required them to be unscrewed to turn off.

He told another employee that he would be done in 10 minutes and that the other employee could then turn the power back one.

They searched the building and found him dead by the electrical box electrocuted. He haunts the building to this day with flickering lights and lights turning on when they?re not supposed to as well as just a general coldness in the area of his death. The other ghost is that of a 12-year-old boy. He and his friend in the early 60's climbed up on the roof of the building to hunt pigeons. He became separated from his friend and his friend left thinking he was gone already. The missing child was not found for 2 weeks until a foul smell was detected at the bottom a roof exhaust that was meant for a boiler that was never installed. The total fall was over 150 feet, And the shaft was hastily completed with many sharp edges and exposed rebar jutting into it. It was not a pretty sight.

Parkersburg	United States	"One mile south of Parkersburg, is a small farming community called Marrtown that was settled by Scottish Immigrants in the mid 1800s. They came from an area of Scotland that believed in many supernatural creatures, including witches, ghosts, elves, fairies and not the least of them, the Banshee. The Banshee is an Irish/Scottish death fairy who attaches herself to Scottish and Irish clans. She sometimes rides a white horse and hangs out at waterways washing out the grave clothes of her dead. She is dressed in a death shroud and other tattered rag and her eyes are blood red from crying for her Scottish dead. Thomas and Mary Marr survived the Civil War, but they lost a lot of property. Thomas went to work on the toll bridge in Parkersburg that went over the little Kanawha River. He would always see a figure on a white horse whenever he came home very early in the morning. On February 5th, 1873, Mary awakened with a feeling of dread. She got up and look out the window and saw someone very old riding a white horse who was coming up to her front stoop. She went outside and saw it was an old woman whose eyes had an eerie glow. Finally, the old woman screamed, ""Mary Marr, Thomas Marr has just died. Say your prayers, Lady. I bid you will."" Woman and horse instantly disappeared. Within the hour, a man who worked with Thomas came to deliver the dreaded news. In fact, Thomas Marr did die -- he died in the icy waters of the little Kanawha River. Some say it was an assailants bullet that brought him down, Others say it was the keening cry of his Scottish Banshee that wailed and startled him into falling and meeting his death in the river below. Many still claim the Scottish Banshee still rides her horse on clear night and she still brings death to those of Irish or Scottish blood. Even to this day, the Marr family is still visited by the Banshee's presence. It would be wise to stay away from Marrtown on cold, lonely, moonless nights."

Curlew	United States	"Curlew/Cascade Job corps. - a former student of Curlew Job corps has heard many of the same stories; how ever, they are set there on the Curlew campus. The tunnel story for the Curlew campus is very likely true, for that campus was a S.A.C. radar compound before the corps took it over. The Dish is still up on top of the hill lovingly referred to as ""Radar hill"". Cascade however, has always been a Job corps campus. Curlew is definitely haunted. Colville Native American Elders believe that the site where the Curlew campus is in the heart of sacred land. Normally sacred land reacts badly to being tampered with, but the Job corps is a place where children go to heal troubled hearts, pasts, and souls. This campus has a 98% success rate because the spirits there are helping where the staff cannot. - July 2005 Update/ Correction - Cascade Job Corps is housed in what was originally Northern State Hospital for the Insane. The Hospital opened for business in 1912 and remained an insane asylum until I believe right around 1970. Locally it is referred to simply as Northern State Mental Hospital.

Duvall / Maltby	United States	It is hidden off to the right hand side of the Redmond Duval Road. (20 miles East of Seattle.) It has about 35 grave sights and strange, unexplained things happen there. People have seen women and children, dressed in old, raggedy looking close, wondering around the gravesites. Witnesses have also felt physical things like being hit.February 2005 additional information: There used to be a staircase that began at ground level and descended 13 steps below ground. I believe the legend/story was that it was a below-grade entrance to the opulent tomb of a locally wealthy family. In any case, kids used to get drunk near or in the cemetery and would walk down these steps late at night. It is unsure whether there were doors or simply a dirt wall at the bottom of these steps. Regardless, once you reached the bottom of the stairs and turned around you supposedly no longer saw the cemetery but a vision of Hell. The similarity in this story to yours is that this vision drove the subject to insanity. Anyone watching the subject walk down the stairs witnessed them stop, turn, and fall dumbfounded to their knees. I’ve heard that several children emerged nearly comatose from the steps – many of them never uttered another word. the story goes that these steps were bulldozed over (depending on the age of the storyteller, the bulldozing occurred anywhere from 1992 to the early 1960’s) and that the severe NO TRESPASSING limitations were a result of that. Furthermore, There is rumor of illegal late night expeditions – kids with shovels hoping to unearth Maltby’s 13 Steps to Hell. It is suggested independently researching this ‘tale.’ Either way, it’s a great story.

Everett	United States	After the sun starts to set and housekeeping has left the basement and turned out the lights, an interesting show starts down there that is caught on the security camera. (Unfortunately, there is no videotape capability for the security camera to catch these events on tape.) On several occasions a shadowy man dressed in a blue or gray janitor's suit was seen to walk up and down the hallway. On other occasions there is the sound of someone noisily opening the washer or dryer although while observing via the camera, it is obvious no one is there and the machines are not being moved. Various clanking and the sound of things being moved around happen about once a night, once again with no one present in the basement. On a separate occasion a cloud of ectoplasm was seen to float across the top view of the camera in the basement, followed by a thunking noise off to the right off camera (the direction the ectoplasm was headed). A final odd incident, a guest's young daughter had the knack of tricking the elevator in to taking her down there -despite the supposed lock on the elevator to prevent such things- and was seen on one occasion holding a conversation with someone who could not be seen, but was heard as a mumbling male voice. Upon inspection by the front desk, there was no one down in the basement, but they experienced an uneasy feeling while retrieving the girl. The hotel has changed ownership twice since being built, so the identity of the gentleman in the basement is unknown. He was not an employee of the current owners. It is thought that he was an elderly maintenance man that died and continues to return to his job despite the change in staff, owners and a hotel name change.

Olalla/Port Orchard	United States	"A woman named Dr. Linda Burfield Hazzard ran a sanitarium back in the early 1900's or so. Her theory was that any disease could be cured by fasting(going for weeks, sometimes months, on end without food). It is said that she intentionally starved her ""patients"" (I prefer to refer to them as victims)to death and buried them on the sanitarium grounds, planting a tree over each body, and when she ran out of room for bodies, she threw them off of the cliff on the back side of where the building once stood. Her reason for killing the ""patients"" was out of greed: she had wills written up (some of them fake)that gave her full possession of her deceased ""patients'"" money and valuables, causing her to gain a fortune by their deaths. All that stands of the sanitarium today is the foundation, and the incinerator in which she reportedly cremated some of the bodies. And the trees that act as sinister headstones to the many nameless innocent people who fell victim to the woman's twisted, immoral and cruel scheme."

It was obviously done in vain because the hauntings still occur.	Gonzaga University	Washington	WA	-117.4023849	47.667189	-117.4260465	47.6587802	1970-01-01		1970-01-01	1970.0	1970.0	True		False	True

Chesterton	United States	Around 1915, the area that is now the Dunes State Park in northern Indiana was mostly uninhabited wilderness. The stories spread around the vicinity of Chesterton, Indiana that fishermen who were along the beach at certain times of the day had been lucky enough to catch a glimpse of a naked woman swimming in the lake. The story spread that a beautiful woman was living as a hermit along the beach and her notoriety grew to a point that many compared her to the ancient Greek goddess Diana...hence the name of this legendary creature. In truth, her name was Alice Marble Gray and she was the daughter of an influential couple from Chicago. Alice had traveled extensively and was cultured and educated. She had worked in the city as an editorial secretary for a popular magazine, so what had made her take up the lonely life of a recluse. Some have claimed that Alice came to the dunes because of a broken love affair but actually she left the city life because her deteriorating eyesight had made her work impossible. She had sought refuge in the rough land that she had enjoyed as a child. Alice moved into an abandoned fisherman's cottage on the beach and lived a life of peace, borrowing books from the library, walking in the woods and of course, swimming naked in the chilly waters of Lake Michigan. In 1920, Alice met a drifter named Paul Wilson and he moved into the cabin with her. He was an unemployed boat builder with a shaky past but he seemed to make Alice happy and the two of them stayed together until 1922.... when tragedy struck. The badly burned and beaten body of a man was found on the beach and police suspected that Wilson had a hand in the murder. He was questioned but eventually let go. He and Alice moved to nearby Michigan City, Indiana, where they made a small living selling handmade furniture. Alice bore her husband two daughters but he treated her terribly, often beating her severely. In 1925, Alice died in her home, shortly after the birth of her second daughter. The official cause of death was said to be uremia poisoning...complicated by repeated blows to her back and stomach. Wilson disappeared and later tuned up in a California prison, serving time for auto theft. The fate of Alice's daughters is unknown. Legends of the dunes say that Alice still returns to the beach and the wilderness that she loved so much. Over the years, many have claimed that they have seen the ghostly figure of a nude woman running along the sand or disappearing into the water.

Inside, visitors claim to see blood stained walls, and smell the scent of decay. Many consider it the most haunted place in Chicago land. - June 2008 Update/correction to updates.: To see more on the history, please check out  http://www.worldmedicalguide.com/medical-disorders/mental-disorders/elgin-mental-health-center-more-than-just-a-psychiatric-facility/. This place has been mostly closed down. The State built additions that are the part that is open and yet it must be regarded that open does not mean open to the public. The old part was closed done due to deadly asbestos that was discovered on the walls and the buildings that were contaminated were all torn down. The reason for the armed guards is that there is both a juvenile detention center and a center for the Criminally insane that exist on the property and the guards are there to make sure no one goes near these areas without clearance.

Elgin	United States	The auditorium is supposedly haunted by a woman in a white lace dress, and can only be seen in the Hallways backstage. - August, 2005 Update: Believed to be a hoax created by 8th grade students to scare the new 7th graders. The school was built in 1951 and was built on farmland in the area that was bought by the local school district U46. There is no documentation that would prove the existence of an activity.- January 2006 Update: Urban Legend. Another District U46 school. Built in 1951, nobody has ever been reported to have died on the property. This is another classic urban legend that students made over the years to scare incoming students. And as a side note please remember that all schools in U46 are on Private Property and unless you are an employee of the district or a student or parents of a student they do not want anyone to be near the place for the safety of the students.

Elgin	United States	The school was about 100 years old. People have said that they hear little children crying or laughing by the k.g. area. Down in the basement people said that they hear noise of someone hamming some type of metal. Teachers seem to stick together when going to their class room. During night time people have said that weird things happen in the building. Few years back the school had a vote to build a new school or to remodel the old building, students and staff voted for a new school. The school no longer stands and place where it once stood is now a parking lot for the new school. - August, 2005 Update: This is a popular Urban Legend Hoax. This school was originally built in the 1940s therefore it is not anywhere near 100 years old. The old building was torn down due to asbestos and a need for a larger building, as the place was tiny but built in a way that they could not expand upon. They rebuilt it so that it was on a different part of the hill that it was on and now more capable of expansion. This was done back in 2000. The building was recently closed after being open for one year due to the fact the district did not have the funding to keep it open as the Person who was superintendent for the last several Years a Dr. Marvin Edwards retired shortly after playing with the accountants books and it was determined that when he left he took several million dollars with him. Thus the district has had to close down many of its schools to save money. Among the schools were Illinois park and Grant Elementary which was one of the oldest elementary schools in the area being that it was Grant that was the 100-year-old school. Thus the whole thing about Illinois park is not fact.- January 2006 Update: Illinois park just so happens to have been built in 1930s. The original building was torn down as they needed to fit more students in the building than there was room for. The newer building was built in 1999. This building is abandoned at the moment due to lack of funding by school District U46 to keep it open. basement in the old building was a large open area used only as storage. The only people that could go back and forth in the basement were the janitors. Though the building is abandoned it is on land owned by the district and the Elgin Police department is constantly on the premises. It is recommended that unless you want to be confronted by a cop that you stay away from the place.WARNING:If there is anyone that is planning on doing anything in any of those locations they must be sure that they have permission first else they will be arrested.

Elmhurst	United States	"At one time it was also called Spaso Speakeasy, originally it was a lovely stone manor. Directions to follow the story, It is said that long ago the woman that owned it hung herself in the attic/which has been converted to the office/storage space for whatever business inhabits the building. The small basement has been used as a liquor/storage room. The building has several dining areas with fireplaces in each one that have been converted to gas. Employees of then Spaso Speakeasy were almost asphyxiated by gas fumes when setting up before opening one day, everybody began to get sick, it was later discovered that the gas for the fireplaces had been turned on but not lit. For years employees have complained that the pull chain light switch at the top of the basement stairs, gets pulled and the light goes out, forcing you to either try maneuvering the stairs in the dark or leave the lower light on, if you walk up the stairs and turn it on and go back down to finish what you are doing, the light chain gets pulled, and the light goes out. There are secret panels and rooms behind the walls, that very few people are aware of, their purpose is unknown at this time. One in particular is between the front entranceway and the kitchen, along the wall to the left. The bar area is particularly active, and things disappear and reappear, such as a corkscrew that disappeared. After exhaustive searching, the manager went out and purchased another one, a few hours later, the missing corkscrew was simply sitting out in plain sight on the bar, in the open. The ghost has been called Mrs. Murphy, although, it is not known if that was/is the true name, and is more like a trickster than a specter. Just an odd note, a Halloween party was held in the year 1989, (then Spaso Speakeasy) a raffle was given for door prizes and the first ticket drawn was *0666, No one held that ticket and it was not in sequence with the role of tickets being used. Most/all businesses in this building have failed, it is/was near the corner of North Avenue and Route 83, If you start out at the intersection of North and York, travel toward Route 83, it is on the right side, one business from the corner, a Peppers Waterbed Store used to be the business just past it. It is within visual distance of the Golden Pheasant restaurant, which is across 83, and on the left. -  December 2005 correction/Update: The Stone Cottage Pizza building in Elmhurst is still there. It had been converted to a relatively popular bar and grill. That business, on westbound North Ave. has failed. There is a sign on it saying, ""scheduled for commercial redevelopment"". Parking availability cannot be blamed for it's closing. The Golden Pheasant restaurant mentioned in the same spot on the eastbound side of North Ave. still flourishes with the same amount of space. North Ave and Route 83, is reported to be the busiest intersection in the state. - March 2007 Update: It is being torn down with two next door establishments and will probably be use for mini-strip mall or something like that. - October 2007 Update: It has been demolished."

They do not want guest and they do not want anyone near the property. they will call the police on trespassers. - the story of the Slave house is, the owner built the house to breed slaves and sell them down south. He had many studs, his most famous was named Big Jim. All of the Slaves, including Big Jim were kept chained in little rooms in the attic. Slavery was Illegal in IL, so the owner has a side entrance built on to the house that a wagon could pull up to and a person or persons could be taken into the house and up to attic without being seen. Some of his victims were free blacks that he kidnapped and held captured until they were sold down south when was done breading them. To this day the attic still has the little stalls with the chains on the wall and floor. You can hear the moaning and crying of the slaves. Some reported seeing Big Jim in the Attic and other places in the house. There is a lot of activity in the house. The owners would give tours and even let people spend the nightin the attic. It is said no one has ever been able to stay till dawn in that attic. A few TV crews, ghost hunters and psychics have tried and failed.

Evergreen Park	United States	"Evergreen Cemetery, 87th St.& Kedzie Ave., A young girl, 12 to 14 years of age, is said to haunt one of the CTA bus stops along 87th St. It is said that she will board a bus, at night, and go immediately go to the back of the bus, without paying the fare. When the driver turns around to tell her to pay, the bus is empty. Some drivers of cars on 87th St. have reported seeing ""heads"" floating above gravestones,( or late night ""visitors"" peeking from behind?) and people sitting on some of the stone benches in cemetery at night. As this cemetery has no fence a more mundane explanation could fit. The Writer has seen vehicles drive right off of Kedzie, over the curb, and into the cemetery at night. This was before this section of the cemetery along Kedzie was sold to the village of Evergreen Park, which built a firehouse, and a skating rink on the site. The Boundaries of the cemetery are 87th St. to the north, 91st St. to the south, Kedzie Ave to the east(actually behind the above mentioned firehouse, but visible from the street), and the B & O Railroad tracks to the west. On the other side of the tracks, is a separate cemetery, St. Mary's, more on that cemetery to follow."

Evergreen Park	United States	"St. Mary's Cemetery, The boundaries of this cemetery are, The B & O railroad tracks which cross 87th St. on the east side, Pulaski Rd. on the west, 87th St. on the north, and 91st St. on the south. Unlike Evergreen Cemetery to the east, St. Mary's has a fence going completely around it, with the main gate on 87th St. and a smaller gate on 91st St. located between Homan and Trumbull Avenues. Late night drivers on 91st St. have reported seeing someone leaning against a fence post along the fence bordering the railroad tracks, with his arms folding across his chest. One driver reported that the figure seemed to react to his driving by, by placing his hands on his knees and crouching down, as if to look at him from under the branches of the tree between them, after which the figure disappeared. That St. Mary's has not had more reports is somewhat surprising, as several deaths, all violent, have happened in and around the cemetery over the years. The first death was in 1927 at a restaurant/speakeasy located along the tracks, at that time many funerals came to the cemetery by train, where the party would have the funeral, then have the after funeral lunch at the restaurant while waiting for the return train. During Prohibition, this restaurant( known as ""Vinegar Hill"") was used as a speakeasy after dark, in 1927 one of the Westside O'Bannion Brothers was murdered there, by the Capone Mob. The next death happened in 1933, on the tracks, about 30 yards south of 91st. At this spot occurred the last daylight Train Robbery in the U.S. Two men stopped the train at this point and stole $50,000. from the mail car. One of the robbers was killed during the robbery and never identified, the other robber was never caught, and the money never recovered. Finally, in the 1990's two men where shot once each in the heart, around 2:00a.m. While ""visiting"" the grave of a rival street gang member, on the anniversary of his death, this murder is unsolved. Trespassing is not only not allowed, but unnecessary, as the only reports of ghostly activity have all been observed from outside the cemeteries, (Evergreen Cemetery, and St. Mary's)."

Indianapolis	United States	haunted by the young wife of the first owner. When you go by the house at night you can see blue lights flickering on and off on the grounds and in the tower window. According to legend the man couldn't stand the thought of burying his lovely young wife so had a special glass coffin built and placed in the tower. He would go visit his wife every night. The tower was lit by soft blue lights, her favorite color. - June 2008 Correction / Additional information: It was located on Fall Creek Road and is now Skiles Test Park. The house was abandoned and torn down in the 1980's. It also says that the owner had placed his deceased wife into a glass coffin and displayed her in a tower. This part of the story is also incorrect. The story goes that Mr. Skiles Test, after the unexpected death of his wife, had her placed in a glass coffin and displayed in a large bay window of his home surrounded by blue lights. Now that Mr. Test has passed away and the house has been torn down, at night you can still see the glow of the blue lights. The story of the house of blue lights is not true but it is a story that I would like to pass down to my children. The reason that Mr. Tests home was called the house of blue lights is because he loved the color so much that he kept his Christmas lights up on his house and around his pool year round. Mr. Test was a very wealthy business man that was committed to his community and even donated a parcel of his land to the Lawrence Township School Board. The school board graciously accepted the land and built an elementary school on it named after Mr. Test. Soon after his death, Mr. Tests family donated his estate to the city of Indianapolis and it was turned into a nature preserve.

Indianapolis	United States	During the first years of construction on this building, a special elevator was erected to move court witnesses to different floors of the building.

Kendallville	United States	The Strand is said to be haunted by one of it's previous owners. There have been multiple sightings of the man. First there was a woman cleaning the theater one day with her 3 and 5 year old children running around. As she was cleaning one of the theater's she heared her children screaming. She went to see what was going on and they both told her that there was a man at the top of the stairs (the stairs that led to the balcony). The woman called one of the workers in and he asked the kids what the man looked like. They gave him a very elaborate description. A few days later that same worker was closing up after the shows and was making sure the emergency exits were closed. As he walked out of the hallway to the one exit he looked up to the projection room and saw a man duck his head really quickly. The man fit the same description the 3 and 5 year old children gave just days before. He ran immediately upstairs; the only way to get to the projection room and there was noone to be found. About a week later a man came along and bought The Strand and the worker noticed this man looked very familiar. He talked to the man and found out that the man's father used to own The Strand as well and killed himself in the projection room years before. I heard this story from one of the workers at the theater now; the same man who saw the ghost when he was a teen working at the theater. The ghost has since been spotted watching people through the projection room window, but ducks immediately upon being spotted.

Joliet	United States	The Frank Shaver Allen house haunting was well-documented in the local press in the late 1970's after a team of psychics and a Joliet newspaperwoman investigated it. The family then living there cooperated in the investigation after having experienced very dramatic paranormal events for over a decade. The house was built for wealthy Frank Shaver Allen in the latter half of the 19th century. He is believed to be one of the lingering spirits there. Also, reported are an elderly woman, believed to be someone who died from a terminal illness in the house; a former nanny and her charge, a young boy; and other spirits not identified. Many, many sightings of spirits and other strange events have occurred at the residence and have been witnessed by occupants, visitors, the psychics and reporter and others such as gas meter readers, etc. A boy who lived there experienced repeated visits from the ghostly nanny and boy who repeatedly invited him to join the ghost boy forever as his playmate. Unexplained, illusory fires have been seen there. A renovation/redecoration of the house inspired a wave of supernatural occurrences. The usual door slamming, odors, shadow-figures, unexplained voices and screams abound.

Merrillville & Griffith	United States	A girl named Elizabeth Wilson drowned in a swamp after the car she was riding in went off the road into a swamp. People say that if you drive down the road at night you can see Elizabeth waiting on the side of the road waiting for a ride back to her house down the road. People who claimed to give her a ride back to her house get as far as Ross cemetery before she disappears. The same cemetery that she was buried in 1955. More history to this road is during heavy mafia activity in Chicago around the 1930's they would dump bodies off this road because it was, at the time, out of the way and seldom traveled. Most of the bodies were not discovered until the mid sixties when the area started to be developed. Through the late 1980's until the mid 1990's the woods around this road became a popular place to commit suicide. Most people that have killed themselves there were area high school students. There are a few houses still on the road, near the main development. Many reports of various apparitions (figures in the woods, ghostly lights, voices, being chased by cars/ creatures). also, mostly due to the fact that it is surrounded by woods, various animal parts are frequently found along the road. these are odd in the fact that they seem to almost always be placed in the exact center of the road. Never an entire animal like road kill, but parts...a head, a leg, a torso. Usually rabbits or raccoons but household pets have also been reported, One person witnessed the head of a large dog, a German shepherd or similar large breed, positioned in the center of the road. There was no blood and the eyes were open staring down the line of the road.	Reeder Road	Indiana	IN			-87.33281389999999	41.4828144	1955-01-01		1955-01-01	1955.0	1955.0	True		False	True

Normal	United States	Atkin Hall - Atkin-Colby Hall is 10 stories tall plus penthouses--what we call the eleventh floors. The building opened in the fall of 1962. The elevators only go up to the tenth floor; you have to take stairs from there to the eleventh floors. The eleventh floors are generally locked and used for storage. I believe people originally lived in them, although nobody has for years. The eleventh floor of Atkin has a presence in it. Nobody seems to know what could have caused a haunting up there, and I don't think a ghost has ever been sighted. But there seems to be a very strong negative presence. You can even feel it on the landing--outside that locked door. I know people who won't go up there alone at night.

Ottawa	United States	Located in Spring Falls off of route 6. The story goes: There was an old biker bar on route 6 in the 1980's and a man and his wife were drunk but decided to go home. He also decided to take the short cut, a small road with deep ditches on each side, not many people took this road back then because of it's size. Anyways there was a curve in the road and the man was going really fast and slung shot him and his wife into the ditch, on impact the wife died and the man was paralyzed from the waist down and was bleeding everywhere, knowing no one could see him in the ditch he went up onto the road and wrote HELP in big letters across the road in his blood. He then went back down to his wife and died later around 3:00. Around 9:00 in the morning a farmer was going down the same road, because this was his normal route and he known the road well. Saw the help on the road and thought that it was some teenagers playing a trick, then seeing the man and woman next to the motorcycle wreck drove to town to the sheriff’s office and told him of what he saw. After the sheriff and his team took the motorcycle and bodies out of the ditch and to the town they had to wash off the HELP in blood with chemicals so no one would become freaked out. the next morning the farmer was going down the road again and saw the HELP as clear as day and was appalled that they didn't wash it off. he went to the sheriff and told him to clean it. Confused the sheriff sent the team out again to clean it, this time the farmer watched, the next morning the farmer again went down the road and saw the HELP spooked, and knowing that it had in fact been cleaned he told the sheriff and they thought that it must have been some kids. So the night-shift sheriff went on his routes throughout the town and also took help road to see if he could catch the kids playing the trick. He went down to the spot around 2:00 am and there weren't any words or people around. Around 3:05 he came back the there were the words HELP in blood. In the same exact writing as it had been the first day. Since then help road has been widen a little and paved over and every time the words HELP appear in the same spot in the same exact way. This is a true story. Have someone go down to Ottawa or Spring Valley and ask around for help road. You will find it and when you do take a picture, some say you can see 2 orbs floating around the site in early hours of the morning. - June 2008 Additional information - Help road is actually located on Rt 6 west of Spring Valley and its a road heading into Depue.

Palatine	United States	Shopping Center - Right on the northeast corner of this intersection, in front of the shopping center, once stood the old Browns Chicken & Pasta restaurant, site of the infamous Brown's Chicken Massacre of 1993. On a cold January morning in 1993, police found seven murdered people stuffed in freezers in the back room of the restaurant, apparently victims of a robbery. The building had stood empty until the following year, and then it became a dry cleaning establishment. It was then when some people experienced very violent, and angry vibes that were not their own, and some had felt sudden decreases in temperature, even during the height of the summer. Nearby residents even claimed they had heard the sounds of faint shots and screaming during the evening hours, often repeated time after time. The cleaning establishment finally went out of business in 1999, and the building was torn down the following year. The oddities still continued. In May of 2002, the two killers were finally apprehended after nine years of little or no leads or progress in the case. Since then, there have been no more reports of any odd feelings or ghostly sounds. It would seem the spirits have been able to rest. For a report on the murders 5 days after check out ABC 7 Chicago news - The story about the girl dying by the diving board in the 1970's was all made up as halloween gag a few years ago by the swim team.

It was a gangland style killing and the hit was supposedly ordered by The Burger gang. At any rate the tavern was a known stop for Bernie at pretty much the same time each day. Many people now claim that the tavern is haunted by Bernie Shelton and there was quite a story in the Peoria Journal Star a couple of years ago where a reporter interviewed the owner and several patrons who swore that the have witnessed experiences of Bernie’s presence in the tavern. -  Febuary 2005 corection: Bernie Shelton was shot with a high powered rifle from the hillside above the tavern on July 26, 1948.

Warsaw	United States	It's called Payton s place and it's very hard to find. From the road in the middle of nowhere you park, walk through a path in a corn field, through a tunnel like path through trees and come to a small clearing where there is a mass family cemetery plot. It started in the 1950's when a father of a family of 4 came home and proceeded to kill each of his family members in there house then hang him self in the barn. This shortly made news papers and news. The relatives started a family plot in the woods not far from the house and barn which still stands but the house is farther back in the woods and hidden. Left as it was abandoned still with pictures on the wall.  So when you come up to this plot there are first 5 small newer tombstones, then a catacomb type building about 4 foot tall and 20 by 15 feet wide, made with stone then covered with primitive cement mix. Portions of the walls are falling off but from what we can tell the walls are at least 1 1/2 foot thick. In there are the 5 bodies of the Payton family. To the left of that is a larger monument with 6 names on it including born, death dates, town from and relationship to the family. This is somewhat newer housing other relatives of the Payton family. The barn can still be found where the father hung him self closer to the road.	Paytons Place	Illinois	IL			-91.4345978	40.35921099999999	1950-01-01		1950-01-01	1950.0	1950.0	True		False	True

Their daughter became possessed as well. - February 2004 update: There is actually a book called ""Watseka"" that details this. Asa B. Roff's daughter had spirits come through her and was thought to be insane. They bled her regularly trying to treat her (getting rid of the ""bad blood"").

Woodstock	United States	"This home was built in the mid 1800's by a couple who were into spiritualism and frequently held séances in their isolated palace in Bull Valley (Bull Valley is said to be one of the closest places to hell). Because of a belief they held, they had the house built with no 90 degree corners, so ""spirits wouldn't get stuck in them"" or have ""a place to hide"" (it is also believed that the devil himself hides in corners). The legend says that the builder left one upstairs corner in the house with a 90 degree angle, and later the entire family was found butchered in that corner. Most of the haunting stories came from a resident who bought the then dilapidated home in the 1970's, who claimed it was ""tainted"" by ""Devil worshippers"" and that he had heard unexplained noises.

Woodstock	United States	"A ghost sits in same seat in balcony and is never occupied. it is always left empty for the ghost during any performance. The ghost is seen walking halls and in the upper windows periodically looking out. She has been seen by the living. Known as Elvira, people have described her as being a beautiful entity, ""whose blond hair hung below her slim waist,"" and who was wearing a ""filmy, dancing gown."" When young actresses are in the theater to try out for a part in a production, the staircase is watched diligently, because sometimes, on occasion, a young actress has the irresistible urge to travel up the staircase to the open portals, probably under the influence of Elvira. So far, all such actresses, in this hypnotic state, have been pulled away from danger. Elvira likes to move props, and untie scenery flats so they fall over, to let the living know that she is there, and needs some laughs as well. Seat DD113 is Elvira's favorite seat in the audience seating area. All the seats are spring-loaded; meaning that they stay in the upright, folded position, unless someone is sitting in them. Actors, actresses and stagehands have often seen seat 113 in the down position, as if some unseen presence was sitting in it, watching the rehearsal. After examining the seat 113, it is always found to be working properly, staying in the upright position. Whenever a performer misses a cue, or bungles a line, a low, deep sigh is often heard, coming from seat 113. Elvira expects high standards to be maintained by the cast of any production. In the 1940's, while Shelly Berman was working on some scenery for an upcoming production, late one evening, he heard a noise from the audience seating, which made him look in that direction. He saw that not only was seat 113 in the down position, but several seats in the same row as 113 as well. Perhaps Elvira, and a few other ghostly patrons of the arts were watching his efforts on stage. Berman ran quickly over to the seats, but by the time he got to them, all were up in the correct, upright position. - June 2008: This story may be a fabrication to get publicity."

About one mile back in the woods near the cemetery is the site of an old house. The old house is where a family of 13 people died from a extremely deadly disease. When the bodies were buried, there were too many of the bodies for a proper grave. The bodies were buried and cement pored over the bodies so the disease couldn't escape. There is a light that hovers above one of the graves, and it is only visible when all lights are off. One resident has noticed that every time a person walks into the cemetery, a tree nearby will make a squeaking sound. To date, that tree has done that every time they have walked into the cemetery.

West Pittson	United States	The claimed incidents began in 1974 and lasted until 1989 in the home of Jack and Janet Smurl. Whether the haunting was genuine or an elaborate hoax is debated. According to the Smurls, the first signs of paranormal activity began in 1974. They reported that a television set burst into flames, and a stain appeared on a carpet overnight. Water pipes began to leak even though they were repeatedly re-soldered by a plumber, and scratches resembling those from a large cat appeared on paintwork and bathroom fittings. Toilets flushed without human intervention, footsteps were heard on the stairs, chest drawers opened and closed unaided, radios worked when they were not plugged in, rocking chairs rocked while empty, and a sour smell filled the house. In 1985, John and Mary claimed to hear loud, obscene language, and Jack and Janet's house became often extremely cold. Two days after this, an icy cold swept the house and a strange black human shape allegedly materialized in the kitchen in front of Janet. It was about five feet nine inches tall, and with no facial features. It later appeared to Mary Smurl in her kitchen. Several TV specials and movies like A Haunting where made about the experiences here.	The Smurl Haunting	Indiana	IN					1974-01-01		1974-01-01	1974.0	1974.0	True		False	True

Woodbridge	United States	Many years ago off of Route 1 in Woodbridge, Virginia were several houses that belonged to old families who would adopt orphans as a way of life. The problem is that big corporal companies came in to build over the houses and so the families were evicted. Years later when the land had begin to furnish again, contractors decided to build over the houses since the plan to construct when they had been torn down had been shunned. When construction began several appearances had been sighted of children running around and giggling in the woods. Machinery started to malfunction and people started to disappear in the woods when bodies of the children had been found in unmarked stone graves around the houses. The area of land is located across from the junkyard that sits across the street from the original orphan house all the way to the forest miles behind and next to Potomac library. The only people who were able to survive in the area and camp there were homeless people. It is said that the orphans take pity on their misfortune and spare them the life they had previously lead.

There have also been stories of your car cutting out and not starting. If you drove down it at night you could see someone hanging from the bridge where someone was hung years ago and that cars have shut off underneath the bridge. - December 2006 additional information: Before you come to crybaby bridge that runs about halfway down from the roads entrance on either side of the vast woods lies a fenced off road that actually heads back into a clearing if you're daring enough to cross the threshold. If you enter the clearing, you will find a solitary building that is long since abandoned with no doors. If you watch, there are red eyes that may appear in one of the open doorways (most likely the very last door all the way to the right) 'watching' you as you move around. Should you get close they may end up vanishing before you can locate them. Going into the building itself, however, yields the very eerie feeling of more than one 'being' watching your every move. It has been seen on film of shadow people walking around along the walls without actually anything being in front of the light source (always in the shape of a tall male creeping along). There have also been reports of people feeling like they have had their feet stepped on, voices whispering, and even hands lain upon the middle of their backs.

Lewiston	United States	Several years ago two girls were murdered in the theatre which used to be a church. Also that night the janitor disappeared and they still can't find him to this day. At night you can see the youngest girl climb up the stairs. She will also play tricks on you. There is also a phantasm there of a woman who was left at the altar when it was a church. You can see her roam through the seats crying. Also one of the old directors who passed away will sometimes come in late at night and sit down to watch a play. Strange feeling can be felt all around. September 2004 addition: there are, at any given time, no less than 70 spirits in the theatre. There's a trap door in the light booth that goes up to the rafters that has opened on its own. Lights turn on and off on their own. The chandelier spins in one direction for ten minutes, stops for five, and starts spinning is the same direction. Visitors lit candles on stage. Some blew out on their own. The ones that didn't blow out didn't burn when you put your hand in the flame. There was wailing that started from stage right and moved inhumanly fast to stage left. Floorboards move inexplicably. All the spirits there are harmless, of course, but it's still an exhilerating experience.

On at least one occasion when staff was in the kitchen discussing ghosts and they shut off the lights the ceiling fans turned on. The only switch for the fans is on the other side of the kitchen 20 ft. away. Locked doors are mysteriously unlocked and opened when the only people that have a key to them are not and have not been in the house that day.

Rindge	United States	The Manor - At the turn of the century, what most know today as The Manor, was previously a brothel run by a woman named Edna McGuinness. McGuinness hung a large portrait of herself in the stairwell leading to the second floor. When McGuinness passed away the building was sold but the portrait was never taken down. During the late 1990's an employee of the college was cleaning the manor after a banquet and heard a piano playing. However, there had not been a piano in The Manor for many years. The employee went searching for the noise and didnt come across anything unusual until she walked by the stairwell and saw the apparition of a woman holding a baby in her right hand walking down the stairs. The woman was wearing a glowing dress and humming. To this day students and faculity members have seen and heard very strange things in and around The Manor. Some say McGuinness can be seen looking out the 2nd story window towards Pearly Pond.

Rye	United States	"""Goldie"" who haunts the top floor of the restaurant. She is known to open windows when they are locked. One night when the owners children were in the bar sneaking drinks she made the phone ring several times. She also made the glasses shake, until they left. Back in the late 50's Rays was a residence. Goldie and her sister Blanche shared a bedroom in the house. Goldie and Blanche both went to homes for the elderly in early 1960. Goldie had all her belongings stored in the attic of the house. Rays was built in the basement of that house and the house then became an apartment on the top of the restaurant. Several nights the two children would see a vision coming from the attic where Goldie's things were stored. On several occasions the attic light would go on by itself. The mother felt a chill in her bedroom on several occasions and one night the ring she left on the dresser was missing. She felt that Goldie was always looking for her things and she just decided to take the ring, as all her belongings had been given to charity. The original Rays burned in the 80's, and there have been no reports of Goldie since. But others have felt here presence too in the old building."

Tonopah	United States	"Charles M. Keller, principal from January 1985 - June 1992, learned of strange happenings when he arrived for duty - lights going off for no reason during the day and strange things at night.  Teachers working late or at night would have feelings that someone was watching them, strange rapping sounds, and one teacher saw an apparition of a man. Mr. Keller wrote a ghost story called, ""Jake, The Ghost"", as a Halloween story for the children, teachers, and staff in 1985.  The story brought forth more reports of strange behavior from the staff.  One teacher working late one evening heard scuffing footsteps coming down the hall toward her classroom. When she investigated she saw nothing but the steps were still coming toward her!  She was so scared she climbed out the window, ran across the street to one of the neighbors and called her husband for help!  It was not until the summer of 2006 Mr. Keller learned the identity of the ghost. He is a writer of children's poems and stories and wanted further research on his story of the ghost.  In September 1903 there was a Chinese race riot.  The local labor union for some reason decided to run all the Chinese people out of town.  During the riot a Chinese man by the name of Ping Ling was badly beaten and hit over the right eye with a hatchet.  He decided to walk out of town and leave the area.  He bled to death on the road. That road now is the same one that is between Silver Rim School and the Mormon LDS Church. Silver Rim School was not built until 1980. Where the ghost of Ping Ling was until that time is uncertain. Why he chose to take up residence of the school is another mystery. Mr. Keller is certain Ping Ling means no harm to the people in the building.  He is not seen or heard during the day when there are activities in the school. But at night he is quite active and curious. However, Mr. Keller made many trips back to the school at night, especially during the winter, to check security and the heating system. He never encountered Ping Ling on any of his trips. He could only surmise Ping Ling respected him."	Silver Rim Ele.

Omaha	United States	"""The Regular"" Bill Wolcott was an older gentleman who, for years, dined at Brother Sebastian's almost every evening. Wolcott had his peculiarities: he often dressed in a formal smoking jacket complete with an ascot tie; he always dined in the lounge, always at the same seat. Unfortunately, Wolcott was stricken with cancer. Although treatments were painful he continued to dine at Brother Sebastian's, even while he was hospitalized. When Wolcott became so ill that he could no longer swallow solid food, the kitchen staff pureed his meals for him. At some point during this time Wolcott began draping a towel over his head while he was in public; but for some reason he was drawn to his favorite dining spot. Wolcott, it appears, felt so comfortable at Brother Sebastian's that he continues to frequent the restaurant even after his death. The last report of Wolcott's ghost occurred on the night of the restaurant’s grand re-opening. A woman seated in one of the back dining rooms complained that someone was staring at her and making her uncomfortable. The ""Someone"" to whom she referred was the face of an old man that the woman claimed was in the stones that make up the wall of the room. Two of the staff also witnessed, late one night after the restaurant was closed and all the doors were locked. They were the only people inside, they saw a swinging door at the rear of the bar open fully, stopped moving as if someone were walking through the threshold, and closed. Anyone who has been inside the building knows that a random wind breezing through to swing doors open and closed is unlikely: Just like the original building (before the 1995 fire), the new structure has no windows.

Omaha	United States	"In Omaha, there is a city park on the northern outskirts named Hummel Park. The background of this park is very macabre to begin with. In the early 1900's, Lynch mobs would ride through town and hang or otherwise mutilate any black people that happened to be in sight. They hung so many black people that the trees still bow over the road leading to Hummel Park. The weird part is that young trees and even the grass lean toward the road outside the park and even inside the park. Apparitions, mists, Indian drums playing at night, wolves howling. Supposed old Indian burial grounds on sight. Also, reports of the morphing stairs. It is a staircase which is roughly 200 stairs long. The word, ""roughly"" is used because every time you go up and or down it you will count a different number of stairs. There is a staircase at Hummel Park that if you walk up to the top and count the stairs going up, it will be less than the number of stairs going down, it is called the stairway to hell because of this. There have been many reports of animal sacrificing in the park. There is also a cult of albinos that live in the park, supposedly.

Braselton	United States	"The older employees at Town Hall will talk about ""Little John"" inhabiting the house.  Town Hall operates out of what used to be a residence built in approximately 1910 by of one of the Braseltons.  The place later because a boarding house/hotel, an event house for weddings and then eventually the city renovated it in the late 90's and used to it to house its town hall, police department and water utility office. Older employees talk about things being moved, odd knocking and footsteps on the stairwell after the close of business, and opening up the business in the morning to find closed/locked desk drawers opened.  Most recently, two employees were standing in the upstairs landing in broad daylight talking when they heard an odd knocking coming from one of the interior closets near the window that is near the attic. One of the police department canines visibly refuses to enter a downstairs conference room that was originally a formal dining room. Little John was at first thought to be some sort of myth created by one of the former patrol division members to delight and scare the female staff members, but some current and some retired employees can tell of the oddities that have sometimes occurred in the house.  ""Little John"" was supposedly a son of one of the Braseltons that had some slight mental problems. Little John allegedly occupied the house for a while and used to pick up stray dogs as pet.  He and the dogs mostly resided in the attic until his death. Although rarely talked about, there is also a report of one of the former Braselton matrons being seen in the downstairs bathroom. Prior to the house becoming the Town Hall, it was sometimes used for wedding receptions and other events. Supposedly, a guest at one of the weddings proclaimed to be a psychic and he told of seeing people dressed in formal attire from the twenties standing in the hall and of seeing the Braselton female in and around the bathroom. Being that no harm ever seems to be done, some of the employees just laugh when things occur and write it off as Little John being in the house.

Pickens County	United States	"There is a bridge off Carver Mill Road in western Pickens County that at one time some 50-60 years ago used to be wooden, that crossed over Scarecorn Creek. Years ago, this couple drove across the bridge and it collapsed on them, thus causing them to fall into the creek below killing them both. The bridge now is paved and well supported. You can drive onto the bridge anytime at night and shut the car off and all artificial light(flashlights, headlights, cell-phone background lights, pager blinking red lights, etc.)must be shut off and wait patiently in the car and this black figure of an average size man will walk from the end of the bridge and to your car and look into the windows. If a woman is in your car it will most likely go to her first and will continue to examine your car. If you crank your car, without turning on your lights, and begin to drive off, the man will chase you until you are off the bridge. Then the ghost will disappear into the night. The ghost is there to try to scare people off the bridge so that they won't face the same fate that the couple did. BEWARE: The ghost doesn't always walk right to your car. Sometimes it just appears at your window and can scare you plum to death. It is best if you do this during a full moon so that there is plenty of ""natural"" light to see the ghost with."

Stockbridge	United States	There are railroad tracks right beside the school. A group of people was crossing the tracks and their car overheated. They just sat there because nothing was coming and they were waiting for their engine to cool down. Well, they started to hear the sounds of a train. They saw a train approaching and tried to get out of the car. Two of the five people made it out. The train rammed right into the car, blowing the car up and sending it flying into the woods right behind the school. You can see the remains of the burnt car in that patch of woods from the playground. Supposedly, on the night and around the night that the accident happened, you will see a hitchhiker. If you pick them up, they will sit with you and you will stall on the tracks. A 'train' will start coming at you.

Nacogdoches	United States	"Mays Hall 11 - Before the building was a dormitory, it was a hospital, with a morgue in the basement. On the other end of the building is a deep, ruined bomb shelter from the early 40s ar 50s. In the basement is a very negative feeling, very hard to describe. It is usually locked, but occasionally residents break in and wander around. It is mild there though. The bomb shelter has been locked for years but last year was broken into. Recently we discovered what appears to be a false wall in there, because the lining on the wall ends (no one noticed before because of the lighting and the junk all over the floor).. The negative feeling from the basement is present in the bomb shelter too, but grows as you near the false wall. Dorm residents are curious to explore but don't want to get caught. No one knows any specific stories, but we all speculate it would have to deal with someone dying in one fo the hospitalrooms. No ideas about what's behind the false wall, though. - Febuary 2005 Correction:there was never a morgue. The first floor of the original wing was the campus clinic which did have a couple of overnight observation rooms, but the city hospital was (and still is) less than half a mile away and the campus clinic was never used for long term care. The clinic closed when the ""short wing"" was built in the 60's, and the clinic was renovated into rooms (which is why those rooms resemble the short wing rooms more than the rooms above. The false wall in the bomb shelter and it was a bomb shelter at one time it still had emergency rations (not sure if they are still there) covers an alcolve that to hold air filtration gear. A shaft behind the wall runs into the main basement."	Stephen F.

Nacogdoches	United States	"""Chester"" haunts the theater building on the Stephen F. Austin University campus. Reputed to be the ghost of the architect who died before the building's completion--some think the blueprints were misinterpreted and the building was erected backwards. Other people believe that ""Chester"" is the ghost of a former drama student. He has been seen as a face on a stage curtain and even once appeared onstage as an extra ghost in a play in the 1960's. Students have reported cold spots and strange noises in the halls of the building.  November 2003 update/correction: Chester was the architect of the building. When learning his plans were set backwards, he killed himself in disgrace. Chester was seen originally in a photo of the original theatre cast of Hamlet. With the actor playing the ""ghost"" in Hamlet sick, the director found the only person who knew the lines. When the cast picture was taken that night, only a faint glow comes from where the ghost portraying the character was standing. Members were dumbfounded. Also, a spiritual team has done readings within the building and found a mediocre feeling within the halls but a strong feeling within the theatre itself."

San Antonio	United States	"Caribbean Apartments - Now known as the Willow Run apartments. These apartments have been in business for over 60 years. Before they were turned into apartments, it was a Motel business. The doors were painted in light yellow and blue pastels. Existing in what used to be the outskirts of town and just outside of Castle Hills, it would bring many customers of all races and origins. It was during this time that a rape and murder occurred in the North end of the complex. Every now and then in the middle of the night a woman's cry can be heard in the rear hallways. And in one of the apartment units, a suicide where a single mother overdosed on pain medication leaving her two year old to fend for herself. The child eventually died of starvation. The mother's body was found on the bed. The child's body was found on the floor next to the bed. It is unknown whether the overdose was accidental or intentional. When this particular apartment is empty the occupants of the downstairs apartment can hear the pitter patter of little feet walking up and down the upstairs unit. On occasion, a woman can be heard crying. Loud thumps can also be heard. Lights turn on and off by themselves and the toilet will flush on it's own. An occupant of the downstairs apartment noted that her young daughter told her ""she was playing with a little girl"". Believing that the child had an imaginary playmate, the mother discounted her little daughter's claims. Until one evening while the mother was sitting in the living room watching TV and her little girl was playing in the hallway with a small toy, she saw her daughter toss the small toy across the hallway into the front bedroom. The door had been left open. Then she heard her daughter talk to this imaginary friend to ""give it back"". To the mother's surprise, something or someone tossed the small toy back to her daughter. The mother kept watching and realized that there really was ""someone or something"" there. On another occasion while sleeping, she felt the touch of little fingers playing with her toes or gently tugging at her blankets. The apartment where the ""suicide"" took place is constantly vacant. Tenants seem to come and go and never stay longer than three years. And when the apartment is occupied, the ""occurrences"" diminish and or are none existent until the apartment is vacant again."

When a traveler named John Savage (no, not that John Savage) fell victim to an axe murder, Chipita was the prime suspect. $600 in gold was recovered from the Aransas River north of San Patricio, as well as Savage's body, in a gunny sack. Josefa Rodríguez and her son, Juan Silvera were indicted on circumstantial evidence. After Chipita pleaded not guilty, the jury recommended mercy, but the judge ordered her executed on November 13, 1863. Chipita was kept in leg irons and chained to a wall in the courthouse until the day of her hanging. Her coffin was placed in an unmarked grave (a moan was said to come from the closed casket). Many people claim to have seen her ghost, a woman with a rope around her neck.

Waco	United States	Baylor Residential - Formerly listed as Brooks Hall - At Baylor University, the oldest college in the state of Texas, exists a mysterious phantom on the abandoned fifth floor of the oldest dorm on campus. Violin music is heard in the dead of night and chilling sightings of a cloaked figure in top hat and cloak staring down and illuminated by an eerie candlelight have been widely reported by spooked residents. Investigations have wielded little fact but the enormous amount of eyewitness accounts and spine tingling sightings have given the legend a grand following. One night the shattering of glass was reported as the phantom peered down and paused his playing and in a fit of apparent rage struck a window. Come morning when level heads prevailed and the storm of the previous night had passed, no damage was found. Still the unpredictable toiling of the phantom have attracted audiences in the witching hour in hopes of catching a glimpse of the mysterious floating candlelight that often hovers from room to room and then vanishes only to appear in the other wing of the building. One unsettling account recollects the viewing of a noose and dangling of a shadowy corpse after the phantom finished the evening’s mournful serenade. Still more haunting is the episode on record of the lights failing the building and an ungodly tapping and cold sensation filtrating the respective doors of the fourth floor of the building. Only one resident dared investigate the unwelcome visitors calling. It is claimed that he peered into pitch darkness to find the horrific silhouette of a cloaked figure in a top hat turn and stare him down through the darkness and calmly vanish out of sight as he glided parallel down the corridor, needless to say it was not pursued. The university has failed to satisfy rumors of hauntings and has downplayed the events for close to half a century now. The Victorian styled villain who roams the corridors of the uninhabited floor and occasionally mingles with the living loves to make an entrance, the hoax is to elaborate for any collegiate prankster and the tradition has endured for too long. Perhaps the only explanation is that the phantom is ultimately unexplainable. - October 2007 Update – This old hall was recently torn down.

The Castle was originally an 1860's rock farmhouse that was purchased in the 1920's by the Whitings. After extensive renovations and the addition of the round crenulated front wing and the rear tower the rambling mansion took on the look of a castle. It was completed in 1938 and Mrs. Whiting, who mostly supervised the renovation, named it ""Inverness"". The residence has seen several owners in the past and at one time Gary Stewart stayed there while filming a movie in the 1950's.

Gatlinburg	United States	TOWER - First, in room 471, in the summer of 1999, a businessman was out of town staying in this room.  He was walking around the pool (next to this room) for most of the evening and into the night hours.  When the pool closed a maintenance man told him that he would have to leave the pool was closed.  This is the last anyone would see of this gentleman because, the next day when he was supposed to check out and did not, a maid went to the room to check things out.  Upon walking into the room, she found the man had committed suicide with a 357.  He had also left a $3.57 tip on the table.  Many have claimed to see a shadow walking around the pool at night in the windows of the rooms around the pool.  Next, in the early 1980's, a boy scout group had rented the entire 7th. Floor of the building.  This is hard to accurately describe, since no one who was working there at the time cares to elaborate on any details from this event, but all that was gathered is that the boy scout leader had apparently gone crazy and killed some of the scouts before being caught.  When the building was closed for the winter one year (Gatlinburg is a tourist town which is really only full for the summer and autumn months) an employee was making rounds through the building and stopped on the 7 th. Floor and heard running and screams he ran to check for intruders only to find nothing, no rooms were rented in the Tower that evening.

Kingsport	United States	This tunnel was built in the early 1920's and is one of the most famous haunted places in our area.

There are reports of a photo taken inside a car in the tunnel and there was the outline of a woman sitting in the backseat. The Shadowlands has not seen the photo.- March 2007 Correction: there are actually 2 tunnels, and the one you can drive through is NOT the haunted tunnel. The other has a creek flowing through it and you have to walk through the tunnel on a ledge. A family explored this tunnel a few months ago and took their 6-year-old son. When about halfway through the tunnel, their son started screaming to the top of his lungs to get out...get out. so they ran out of the tunnel and asked what was wrong...he said he heard a baby crying in the tunnel.

Knoxville	United States	Baker Peters Jazz Club is a known haunted site in Knoxville. Now a trendy & expensive Jazz bar, it was once a Civil War era residence. The baseline of the story goes that the house was built by a Dr. James Harvey Baker. Dr. Baker's allegiances in the war are disputed; some have him on the side of the Confederates, others have him as neutral. Either way, he did have at least one son that we know of named Abner who fought staunchly for the Confederates (other versions have Dr. Baker with TWO sons on opposing sides of the war). During an invasion by the Union army in 1864, Dr. Baker was treating wounded Confederates in his home when the Union army arrived and demanded the surrender of the men in the house. Dr. Baker refused and barricaded himself and in his bedroom. The Yankees invaded the house, raced upstairs and shot him through the door. Upon returning home, 22 yr old Abner vowed revenge on the person who informed the Yankees that his father harbored Confederates. He did kill the informer, a postmaster, but was later killed by the informer's friends in a return act of revenge. Legend has it that Abner has refused to leave the house that he and his family fought so hard to retain. The house went through several changes of hands before becoming a jazz bar, which was likely very disrupting to whatever spirits are there. Baker Peters claims to have a framed photo of what looks like Abner's ghostly reflection posted somewhere in the restaurant. Other accounts report employees experiencing chills, hearing whispering, objects moving or being thrown from shelves and breaking, and even (in the early days) discovering a hanging candelabra in a dining room with the candle holders twisted downward.

Also it is told that if you see the light on in the doll house at night she is there playing. Former caretakers of that cemetary report until the new caretaker built a house at the end of the drive. The new caretaker now has a gate up and noone is allowed down the drive from dusk til dawn. Also the story of the light didn't start until YEARS after the little girl was buried.

Also he repainted the doll house. Since then there has been NO defaceing of the property, littering, or teens out partying in the graveyard. After the caretaker moved into his new home the light has been removed.

Nashville	United States	Belmont Mansion - Adelicia Hayes first marriage, to a wealthy businessman, lasted seven years, in which their four children all died by age eleven. In 1849, her second marriage resulted in the building of the Belmont mansion; it was built in the style of an Italian villa set in elaborate gardens.

A surgeon was summoned to crudely stitch him up just enough to keep him alive until the execution. With his collar buttoned to hide the wound, he was drug up the steps on his appointed day. When the trap was sprung, the stitches ripped open, nearly decapitating him. Blood spewed into and all over the crowd.

Bartow	United States	"Construction on the old courthouse was completed in 1909; there is now a newer, much larger courthouse across the street from the older structure, and the old courthouse now houses the Polk County Historial Museum and Genealogical Library. Although the 1909 courthouse was the third building to serve as the courthouse in Polk, it's only the second courthouse to have been built on that particular plot of land (the one before that was built in 1883). The boiler room is located in one of the four basements (it's the basement accessible by elevator only), and many years ago there was an explosion there, killing one male worker; staff, cleaning crews, and visitors have reported hearing screams of pain coming from that basement. The bodies of the Mann brothers, who were lynched by a mob for murdering Marshall Silas Campbell in the street outside the courthouse, were brought and displayed for several days in 1886 in the 1883 courthouse on the second floor the area of the old courthouse corresponds with the second floor rotunda of the 1909 courthouse - there is a feeling of sadness there, and apparitions have been seen on the spot where the bodies were laid out. Also, near the second floor bathrooms and on the third floor, the apparition of The Lady in White has been observed by many people - it isn't known who she is, and she could be one of several women who had strong ties to the building. Strange things have been observed in a room containing ancient Native American artifacts on the first floor, from cold spots to malfunctioning lights. In the actual 1909 courtroom, cold spots are felt and sometimes people feel something ""brushing"" against them - the exact cause isn't known because every trial from 1909 until the new courthouse was completed in 1987 was held there, but it's believed it might be Judge Chillingsworth, who was murdered along with his wife in West Palm Beach and whose gangster killers were tried in that courtroom."

Fort Pierce	United States	"There is an old antique store sitting on a hill overlooking the St. Lucie River on US1 that is long rumored to be haunted. In the early 20th century, a man was brutally murdered by his wife on the staircase of their house which later became an antique store. When you come upon the second floor, the smell of cigar smoke seems to follow you around and you never feel completely comfortable. The stair on which the man was killed makes a horrible sound whenever it is stepped on and an old man was ""pushed"" down the stairwell on that exact stair a few years ago on Halloween night. The owners boarded it up after Florida experienced all of the Hurricanes and there is no word on whether or not it will open again."

Jacksonville	United States	Traveling slowly down Greenbriar Road late at night may be hazardous to your mental health if the Greenbriar Light decides to follow you. Motorists say this mysterious ball of light appears from out of nowhere and bobs along behind their cars, sometimes hovering over them, but never passing on the road. Reports were so numerous that the Sheriff's Department dispatched scientists to investigate the mysterious luminescence. No explanation could be found. However, locals connect the light to the untimely death of a young man on a motorcycle, decapitated when his bike hit a cable in the road. Supposedly the Greenbriar Light is the solitary beacon of his motorcycle, searching the road endlessly for... its missing parts. - June 2005 Update – The light actually came from the very end of Greenbrier (which at that time was a dirt road) where SR 210 heads directly towards it and then curves away. A witness recently reports they have been out there many years ago and it was a little scary in the middle of the woods on a dirt road seeing what looked like one headlight coming towards you and then one brake light going away. They have since changed the way 210 and Greenbrier intersect and with the change, the Ghost Light went away.

Miami	United States	Field adjacent to LaSalle High School & Mercy Hospital - LaSalle High School is located at 3601 So Miami Ave in Coconut Grove. LaSalle High School and Mercy Hospital are adjacent to one another, the grounds are on the water's edge and you can view Biscayne Bay from there. The story originates from the 70's or 80's when supposedly a young girl attending the school (which is an all female Catholic high school), either committed suicide over a broken heart or took an accidental drug overdose in this field. In the suicide version, she was a student athlete, which is why she haunts the field, and has been seen occasionally during daylight hours at sporting events and has been mistaken for a participant.

Before the park was built, they were going to cut down the tree, but their chainsaws kept malfunctioning in the area surrounding the tree. They tried to cut down the tree manually with a two-man saw, but the teeth of the saw broke off, so they left the tree where it was."

Spring Hill	United States	formerly 7-11 - In the early 1980's in the town of Spring Hill which is outside the city of Brooksville there was a 7-11 convenience store which took in most of this towns business. And since it sat along the towns main road it was easy to access Highway 19 to the west about 3 miles away, or the longer haul 7 miles to the east. At one point during the night in the late 80's a drunk male came into the store to buy a case of beer. But the clerk decided out of his own good will to not sell the case feeling the man was drunk enough already and did not want him to drive back to the store later on. The man became angry yelling and cursing so on and so fourth. So instead of buying beer he decided he wanted a pack of cigarette’s. After the purchase the clerk turned his back toward the man to grab some cleaning stuff from under the counter. At this point the man revealed a .357 revolver and shot the clerk in the back of the head killing him instantly. Now the 7-11 has since moved and now it is a Hungry Howies pizzeria, and as the night moves further on more this will happen. The saloon doors to the kitchen will swing open, cups and utensils will fall off the tables and onto the ground. The hanging lights will start swinging back and fourth and the lights and arcade games will suddenly shut off. The strangest occurrence happened one night when one worker left the store one night after setting up for a new promotion and came back a few hours later to help the owner for the early shift and found all the pictures and posters laying on the ground or on the counters directly under where they were placed and the security camera tape was blank but yet still recording.

St. Augustine	United States	The Lighthouse - near St. Augustine, many spirits are here; one of a man who hung himself (when, not known), and one unidentified spirit in the basement of the keeper's house. During the 1980's, when the keeper's house was being restored, workers spent the nights in the place to protect it from vandals. They would wake up in the middle of the night to see a small girl in old-fashioned clothes watching them. She would then vanish. The workers would also sense things during their work and would look up to see an apparition of a man hanging from a rafter. The spirit in the cellar has never been seen, but workers at the lighthouse all report an uneasy feeling when they're down there alone, especially at closing time when the place is very quiet. There have also been stories of footsteps on the lighthouse stairs when there's no one around. The guides there are very open about the ghosts. There are many good reasons for the lighthouse and keeper's house to be haunted: the man who hung himself, the little girl who was killed by the train, a light keeper who fell to his death while painting the former lighthouse (very close to the newer one), and 13 executed pirates who were buried behind the lighthouse. Also, there has been some form of a lighthouse on the site since Ponce De Leon in the 1500's.  - Update about the little girl spirit, it is believed that there are 2, They were daughters of the lighthouse keeper and of the foreman when the new lighthouse was being built further up on the island. They used to play on the train-carts that were used to haul supplies from the water to the new location of the lighthouse. According to the local historical society that provides tours of the area, the girls were playing on a cart with the daughter of the foreman. Apparently, the brake was loosened, sending the cart hurtling toward the inlet below. Three of the 4 girls (2 of the keeper's daughters and the foreman's daughter) were not saved in time and drowned when the cart flew into the water. Occasionally, you can hear girls giggling in the vicinity of the lighthouse, and the girl that appeared to the workers was also one of the daughters that is more active than the others.

Tallahassee	United States	Cawthon Hall Dormitory- According to a story reported in the University newspaper, The Florida Flambeau during the summer of 1971, numerous students have related encounters over the years with a poltergeist in an old dormitory. According to the report, several years prior to the University's becoming coed in 1949, a female student was sunbathing on a balcony on the roof of the shadowy gothic building. As is typical in Florida, a sudden and particularly violent thunderstorm arose to the east of the building, and welled up ominously over the campus. Although the sky directly above the dormitory was blue, a freak lightning bolt snaked across the sky, curling over the building's turrets striking a sunbathing female student, killing her instantly. Since that time, subsequent occupants of the room she occupied have reported mysterious object movements, unexplained sounds in the room at night, and at times an overwhelming sense of another individual present in the room. Sometimes students would find that common items, such as stacks of books or pictures, would be moved around during the day, with no apparent rhyme or reason, other than perhaps a restless spirit seeking to maintain her link with the world of the living.

Winter Park	United States	Annie Russell is widely believed to haunt this theatre named for her in the early 1930's. She was a teacher and director at Rollins College. She has been seen and even spoken to by numerous people. There are stories of former students who had encounters with Annie while working in the theatre on audition pieces, sets, or lights. One story in particular that sticks in my mind is there was a guy who was working alone in the theatre on the light grid. Suddenly he fell off the ladder. He was all alone in the theatre and lay there for a few minutes. Someone came in a few minutes later and saw him laying there. The person immediately went to call an ambulance and was told that they had already been called and one was on it way. A minute later, an ambulance appeared and took the injured boy to the hospital. There was no one in the theatre when that boy was initially injured. There have been other stories of people seeing Annie's statue (a bust of her head) moving across the theatre. Also, Annie had a seat that she always sat in when she watched rehearsals- that seat has often been heard banging up and down, pulled down when no one was sitting in it, and clapping has been heard coming from that area of the theatre.

Auxvasse	United States	Supposedly, a long time ago, black women were hung there, and slave children were drown in the creek. When you shut your car off on the bridge or near the church and cemetery, and go to start it again, it makes funny noises. When you sit in the ledge of the bridge, take your shoes off, and dangle your feet above the creek, you can feel a weird tickling feeling on your feet. Myth says it's the slave children drown there tickling your feet. You can see peculiar lights like sets of eyes that blink every now and then, under the bridge, in the trees along the creek, and in the cemetery up on the hill by the creek. Also, if you go out on a dark night, when there has been no running water...in forever, stop your car on the bridge, and roll down your windows, you can hear what sounds like water running in the creek, but also strangely, foot steps in the weeds and leaves. If you stay and hang out for a while, like an hour or more, when you come back to your car, there are what appears to be foot and hand prints on your hood and windshield. - June Update/additional Information - it's said that if you turn your engine off on the bridge that it won't start again. You'll have to push the car off the bridge onto the gravel road to get it to start. The poster tried this once and it started right back up. There's another variation to the story, but it's the same thing as what was submitted about Albino Farm Bridge in Springfield, Mo. There's also the ghost of a woman seen walking on the bridge at night. There may not be any truth in these stories about either place. Of all the people talked to about these places over the years, no one ever says that they themselves have seen anything.

Diehlstadt	United States	About half a mile into the woods there is a creek that an old set of train tracks used to go across, and one night a homeless man was walking down the tracks sometime around midnight and he had sat down to catch his breathe and fell asleep. The man woke up to the vibration of the tracks but didn't get up in time and the train ran over his neck and decapitated him. Now if you go out there around midnight on a certain day you can see him stumbling around looking for his head.

Doniphan	United States	"There's a statue of an angel (one that is a woman, not a child). The legend has it, that if you go there at midnight on a full moon only, that the statue cries bloody tears. It sometimes lasts till 1:00 A.M. And during this ""witching"" hour, it's said that you can walk through the graveyard, and hear the faint voices of the dead. Some people (including myself) have seen a white woman in the back of the cemetery coming out of the wall of one of the old crypts and walking along the row of headstones. She carries a white cat with no head, and cries mournfully. Legend says that she was a lady who lived in the area in the late 1920s. Her indoor cat ran outside and she ran after it. When she scooped her beloved cat up in her arms in the middle of the street, they were both run over by a beer wagon."

Dumas	United States	"May 2005 Update: the train wreck that spurned the headless woman story occurred in late summer, or early fall of 1892, with sketchy fatality lists stating approx. 13-27 deaths, many being thrown into the river. Therefore, the wreck occurred near the river overpass nearly 1/2 mile from the tunnel underpass. They believe the woman's head was lost to the river and now she eternally seeks it. She walks in the fall, mostly. When she passes thru you, you will feel like a thousand icicles stabbing thru you. Also, there is a cemetery south of Dumas, mostly Catholic burials, with one being a 104 year old woman from Ireland. A visitor was ""attacked"" by the presence of something malicious there one night and it took a Christian psychic to remove the spirit as it was feeding off their energy. Whatever dwells outside this cemetery is neither human nor animal but something from a dark place. The tunnel underpass itself is benign, only haunted by ignorant teenagers who deface it with their graffiti. There is a small dwelling adjacent to the tunnel where a huge, mean dog lived, now dead. His ghost still roams there. It has orange, glowing eyes. There are also several dead babies buried around the area. A woman kept having miscarriages and her husband buried the corpses all around the area. In the 1950's, a man committed suicide in the forest near the river by drinking poison and his body or skeleton, rather, was found sitting under a tree."	In northeast Missouri there are train tracks that are haunted by a headless woman that died in a train wreck many years ago. At least every night she appears around 11:00pm every night in the tunnel below the tracks.	Missouri	MO			-91.6354393	40.52115089999999	2005-05-01		2005-05-01	2005.0	2005.0	True		False	True

But many odd things turned up once they began to investigate the wreck. A few things were that a woman had been pregnant when she was killed in the wreck and once they found her, the baby was missing out of her womb. Another man had become decapitated during the wreck and the police could never find his head. So once you get to the railroad track you pull onto the tracks and shut off your car. Your windows start to fog up very quickly and you can hear a train whistle in the background, it gets louder...then stops. You will often also see a light when you look down the train tracks. While sitting in the car you will hear something tap on your window and if your brave enough to look outside a woman will be standing there asking you where her baby is. And for the extremely brave, if you decide to get out of you car you will see a decapitated man in the ditch searching for his head, many people have saw this (including myself).	Wilcox Rd.

Raytown	United States	"This road has constant twists and turns throughout it. There are no street lights but woods on both sides lining the edge of the road. It has a age-worn brick wall along the side that looks like a old, overgrown cemetery. A valuable source has said they saw a cemetery on either side of the road the first time they had driven on it. Just as they had went around a curve, they said they had seen a woman in it stretching her arms toward the road-or possibly them and standing still. They described her as wearing a wedding dress and a veil. They were going to return at sunrise to look around (they liked to photograph cemeteries). When they had returned to the location, there was no cemetery, but a house under construction, and a wide open field, and on the other side, some trees on a small cliff. They said that the cemetery couldn't have been their imagination, they weren't even thinking about anything to do with it, or scared for any reason. Another resident described seeing a head with a terrified expression on its face roll out of the woods and under the front of the car, again not finding anything when he went back to find out if his mind was just playing tricks on him. There is a old run down wood bridge about half way down the road, and a series of chevron signs before it. Somebody has spray-painted with red paint a letter on each of these signs. Oddly enough there was a perfect number of signs for them to spell M-U-R-D-E-R D-I-E and the last sign which is directly beside the beginning of the bridge says ""Back & Here"" (whatever that means). You have to slow down for the bridge and go about 5 mph over it because the wood is so warped, and numerous people have said when they do this they notice lots of movement on both sides of the bridge and sounds of something walking (on two legs not 4). All reports have been said to have been during the night and one during the day, and for some reason if you bring up Rickey Road all the locals voices change and they all know of it and have their own stories to tell. Though most of them wont utter details only that they have been there and something had happened to them that has made them never want to return.

Richland	United States	"In the early 1900's a black man named Joe was accused of raping a young white girl. He protested his innocence saying, ""God would prove I didn't do it"". Legend has it that he survived the electric chair but a group of vigilantes took him to the cave where he was tarred and feathered and then hung with barbed wired in one of the larger back rooms of the cave. Joe had been a fiddle player and each night after supper would sit on his front porch and play the fiddle. Now if you go to the cave just around dark you can hear his fiddle music echoing though out it. -  May 2005 clarification/ correction: This is a historical incident, so there are records that provide the date (1839), the name and age of the girl (Amanda Fulbright, age 10), the name of the man who killed Joe (Thomas Rafferty shot him). Joe's dead body was taken from the Fulbright property in Laclede County, MO, to the cave in Camden County, MO (about 10 miles), a medical doctor dissected the body, boiled the flesh off the bones, and rearticulated the skeleton. The doctor’s motive was knowledge of anatomy. Also, the cave does not have any ""larger back rooms."" The first room goes about 75 feet, then tapers down to a hole only large enough for a modest stream of water. No human could enter the hole. And, of course, there was no electric chair in 1839, and barbed wire wasn't invented until about 1876."

St. Louis	United States	"parking lot - This site was formerly the Gratiot Street Prison. Here is a bit of history on the place. The building had been McDowell's College, a medical college owned and operated by Joseph Nash McDowell. It was confiscated by the Federal authorities in the spring of 1861. In December 1861 the building was converted into a prison and later renamed. Even early Federal records often call the place ""McDowell's College."" It was right in the midst of some of the wealthiest homes in St. Louis. General Fremont's headquarters in the Brant Mansion were only a block away. Right across the street was the home of the wealthy Harrison family. Attached to Gratiot on the north was the Christian Brothers Academy. Unlike other Civil War prisons, Gratiot was used to hold just about anyone and everyone. Along with Confederate prisoners of war were also held civilians (""citizens""), women, children, confiscated slaves (""contrabands""), spies, saboteurs, political prisoners, guerrillas and bushwhackers, and even Federal soldiers who had committed crimes or had misbehaved. Of Confederate soldiers held at Gratiot, the most likely ones came from battles and states in the Mississippi River region as far south as New Orleans. They were sent north for processing at Gratiot then moved on to Alton and other eastern prisons. Also soldiers fighting in Missouri and Arkansas would be sent to St. Louis.

Strange sounds can be heard coming out of the mineshaft late at night. What did those miners uncover digging so deep in the earth. Was it a secret passage to hell? - September 2004 update/correction. A reader did some research on the Mine in regard to why it shut down. Several newspaper clipping at the two local newspapers and other documents found on-line dealing with economics, Prices, etc., state that due to a huge decrease in Iron prices, the Mine was shut down in 2002 because of operational costs. (which took me almost two months to find out. Nothing was found about Mine on the town's main web pages. Really makes it look like they were hiding something. But it looks like all they were hiding was a big money and job loss to the town.)

Truxton	United States	This abandoned haunted house you can see off of highway 70. Take the Truxton exit and get off at the service road. Follow the service road and watch on the right. You'll know when you've found the house. No history is known. But witnesses report hearing a chilling women's scream echoing throughout the empty rooms. Footsteps have been heard on the steps, banging has been heard in the basement. And a dark shadow figure has been seen in the top left window. There’s always an overpowering sense that someone is watching you from that top window, and it's a horrible feeling.  NO TRESSPASSING  This is house is  PRIVATE,  and the owners who live down the road do not like visitors. - December 2005 Update/Additional Information: there was a family who lived there. The husband died in 1940, in 1963 the women died - killed herself by slitting her wrists. The submitter of this additional information reports they own property in Herman, which they have passed this house for many years. Their father went up to the house in 1975 because he was curious on buying the property. At this time the house looked, as it had been standing vacant for many years. He thought it was abandoned. So when he made his way to the back porch and looked in side, there was a women gray hair rocking back in forth in a rocking chair. - who was this woman? The women that owned the place killed herself in 1963 this is 12 years later - there wasn't suppose to be anyone there - no other relatives. The house is in unsafe conditions.

Warrensburg	United States	Houts/Hosey Hall - is supposedly haunted by a girl who killed herself while she was pregnant. Her ghost is said to walk the halls, knocking on doors, and calling for her baby- asking where it is. Shadows are seen under the doors when no one is walking by. During a séance 2 different room numbers where given and one of them was a room that was not used, the other room of a suite used by a community advisor (like an RA). This room’s door looked very different from the rest of the doors, had a sort of- darkness above it. And was very obviously off-limits to residents. Rumor is that the numbers of the rooms in that building had been reassigned so that no one would hear about the room the suicide victim lived in and not want to live in it. This could be just a rumor, though. - October Update: This is the legend of Sarah. An eye witness to both the séances reports the findings were fake – that nothing happened.

Warrensburg	United States	Yeater Hall - the oldest resident hall on campus, there is a long history of mysterious happenings. Residents have reported lights coming on in rooms unoccupied and locked, curtains opening on their own. One set of residents reported a commotion at their door one evening and footsteps above their room in a room that was vacant and locked, in fact the entire floor was padlocked and no one was allowed on that floor. Other residents have reported cold spots during the summer in this un-air-conditioned hall. A shadow of just a woman's head was seen by two women during a summer cleanup when the hall was supposed to be empty. Men, in this Women's only hall, feel like they are being watched and male campus maintenance workers have complained of drawers opening and closing in rooms they are working in, when no one else is present. The third floor is padlocked shut, as is the attic. It has been said that if you knock twice on the attic door someone will knock back. Witnesses claim that this is indeed true. Third floor of Yeater hall was used in 2001, it was not until spring semester of 2002 that it was padlocked. The ghosts are believed to be those of Laura Yeater (the dorm mother when the dorm was new, and whom the dorm was named after), and of a man who served in the military at a time when the dorm was *for sure* used as housing for the military (there is a base nearby as well). - October Update The most famous and most blown out of whack. An investigator investigated 3 known entities in this hall. The story of the shadow seen by 2 workers was solely investigated by the ghost hunter. There have been times kids state they see things and once a boy was petrified on the stairwell saying he saw something and it took a very long time to get him out of his trance. Most of the information that was originally posted was taken from lectures the ghost hunter gave at the college, and the above updates where reported by him. If interested in talking to him, the staff would probably give you information if they check with him first.

Middlebury	United States	"Located in the woods, on the side of an abandoned road (possibly old Waterbury Road), is a village of sorts, a number of very complex and detailed small stone houses standing about three to five feet high built into the hill. Some of the buildings are A framed, others are more traditional, they have the appearance that they are gutted and ""condemned"", inside of the little houses are elaborate room structures, staircases; pathways lead up hills through the woods to them, tiny pathways. The area is overgrown. Built into the side of a rock is a ""thrown"" a life sized chair of sorts with several symbols around it- the legend is that if you sit on it you will die in 7 years- this is only legend though. Next to the village itself is the ruins of an old stone house with iron bars on the window... very negative energy comes from here. In the evening the road to the village is so loaded with negative energy that it is virtually impossible to travel it... it is soundless and still. En route to the village and at the village itself several pentagrams can be seen from time to time on the ground. Overall a very eerie, very negative feeling pervades the area of this extremely mysterious village in the woods.- November 2003 Update: It is actually right off I84 exit 17 on the Middlebury/Waterbury line. All the other info is pretty accurate, there is really only one little house left and that is partly destroyed. The stone house is still there and so is the thrown. There is also a cellar that you can go down into. Place is very spooky. Legend is that there was a man and women who lived there and she was crazy and thought she was the Queen of the little people. She made her husband build her a thrown and all the little houses. Then she killed her husband and herself or he killed her and himself. There are different variations of the story."

Milford	United States	"located off of Silver Sands state beach has a long and mysterious history. It was a point of conflict between the English settlers and the Wepaowag Indians, who regarded the island as sacred ground, connected with spirits. Following the defeat of the tribesmen, the Chief put a curse on the island, pronouncing ""Any shelter will crumble to the Earth, and he shall be cursed"" About 25 years after the defeat of the Wepauwags, the notorious pirate Captain Kidd, who knew the islands reputation, is known to have buried part his treasure on the island, and treasure hunters from around the country still look for this stash today. It is told that in 1850 two men found the treasure, only to run away from the island screaming about a ""screeching, flaming skeleton descending from the sky"" They spent the remainder of their lives in an asylum. At the end of the 18th century, a monastery was built on the island. After the monks moved in, dismissing the curse as ""pagan savagery"" and ""Indian folklore"", a series of mysterious deaths, suicides, and bouts of insanity, and subsequent intensifying hauntings forced them to abandon the monastery. The crumbling ruins can still be seen today. In the 1950s and attempt was made to open a seaside restaurant and lodge on the desolate island. A devastating and lethal fire, still to which cause remains unknown, ended whatever building projects scheduled for the Island, and no one has built upon it since. All that is left from this is a tumbling brick wall. Today, reports from hikers abound about seeing glowing specters flitting through the trees, disembodied voices, and phantom monks making processionals through the monastic ruins. One also hears of seeing nighttime Indian festivals and hearing jazz music near the old site of the restaurant. The only access to the Island is a mysterious causeway that only surfaces from the sea at low tide. People, in the summer months, frequent the island for its beach and seclusion, as well preserved trails. The ghosts wont bother you if you respect them. Just don’t build, and DONT DIG!"

Windsor	United States	One can expect that such an old establishment would have a history. In Founders Hall, which used to contain a dormitory on the 3rd floor, it is said that one or more students killed themselves. Late at night, the second and third floors have a significantly unsettling feeling about them, and without the lights on, one cannot see to from one side of the hallways to the other. Doors seem to open and shut on their own, and light footsteps, like someone sneaking about, can often be heard. Though these occurrences may be quite freaky, any spirits that may inhabit the area do not seem malicious. There is also a system of tunnels that runs beneath the school (this is no rumor, these tunnels EXIST). Footsteps of person sprinting can often be heard at late hours, and some have reported seeing a man with straight black hair standing motionlessly at the end of one tunnel, staring intently at the wall. Visitors are warned not to go in these tunnels alone, as whatever is there seems rather unwelcoming. Some persons who decided to go alone came out with scratches and bruises on their arms and chest. The Health Center has been known to harbor a woman in white who tends to sick students at night. One student reported waking up in the early morning (~3 AM) and being given water by a woman in white. When she woke up later, she spoke to the nurse on duty. The nurse told her that she had been the only one working all night. The woman in white could possibly have been an early headmaster's wife, who died young and spent time caring for ailing students in the health center.

Duluth	United States	"There is a night club in the western part of Duluth called Spirit Valley,(go figure). The building was built in the late 1800's and was previously 4 stories tall, now a single story due to a fire. Even though no one was hurt or killed in the blaze, the bar has quite a lot of paranormal activity. It was quite a colorful place back in the day, being a reported ""house of commercial affection"", gin mill, speak easy, etc. There are a couple of ongoing events that are quite commonplace. Near the west doors are a couple of pool tables. Just off the far right corner there is a corner drink table where many people have had been either shoved, poked brushed or had their stick bumped to only discover that there is no one there. The other instance is the old woman who shows herself only to men. Mostly men who work there, including yours truly. Many staff members have heard the bathroom's doors open and close, slam shut, swing open violently, the back security door open and slam shut, and no one being there. Attesting to this is it mostly happens after closing time when only the staff is there cleaning up with perimeter alarms set that if anyone was in these areas it would trip the alarms. - May 2008 Update: burned down last year.

In the mid-1980s the building housed a dormitory for the local community college.

St. Paul	United States	The Marian Center in St. Paul is a nursing home located in what was once the old Mounds Park Hospital. It was closed as a hospital sometime in the 70's and reopened as a nursing home in the late 80's/early 90's. The story is that an off duty policeman who was working as a security guard was shot and killed as he was getting off the elevator in the basement, which is where the morgue was located. There are four elevators in the building, but if you get on that particular elevator, no matter what direction it is going or what floor you push, it will go straight to the basement, open, and then close again before going to where it's directed. The employee break room is in the basement but is rarely used, as you have to walk past the old morgue to get to it and there are strange noises there at night. There was also a tunnel from the basement leading to the old nurse's dormitory, which was once used for storage. The maintenance men disliked using it because they reported hearing strange noise and lights flickering off and on. The property sits across the street from a group of Indian burial mounds.

Lancaster County	United States	Devil's Stomping Ground - This area is kind of similar to a crop circle, as it is a circular area in a field in which there is no life, no plants grow in this circle and not so much as an ant or earthworm can be found within.

Summerville	United States	"The Story goes that a woman had a husband that was a conductor for a railroad company in Summerville...and he worked nights. At midnight every night, people could always see her there, waiting by the tracks with his lunch and a lantern...waiting for him to stop to eat. One night, he never showed. She was told that the train had derailed or crashed, and he was beheaded and, of course, killed. Although they buried his remains, she would never accept the fact that he was gone, and so, she went to the tracks at midnight with her lantern and walked up and down, waiting for him. People of course began to think she was crazy, but she continued this nightly ritual until her own death. Mysteriously, the light never stopped coming. This is what my mother told me happens at her visit to THE SUMMERVILLE LIGHT: When you go to the tracks, just before midnight, you can hear all the sounds that are usually heard at night, crickets chirping, frogs croaking...the breeze blowing.... but for some odd reason, and this has been the case for every person who has seen THE LIGHT...at midnight, the sounds suddenly just cease. As if a presence has quieted them momentarily. Then you can see it, usually its far off, a light and nothing else...coming your way. If you stick around, THE LIGHT will chase you. Scared visitors tried to jump in their car and leave and the light came upon them swiftly, and they heard a BUMP on their car, as they sped away. When at a safe distance from the sighting, they got out and looked, and there was a dent on the car, where the lantern hit it. Others have had their car stalled and even a report of having a strange burn mark on their hood. - May 2008 Update: The Summerville end of this road is completely blocked off by dirt mounds and is impassable.

Administration buildings, Dormitories, Classroom buildings, Crematorium, and Community building w/ greenhouse, and a room entirely filled with x-rays and incident reports of patients dating 1968 to 1987.  But the Hospital was supposedly closed in 1982.

Adams	United States	Woodglenn Park - In the late 80's, early 90's at the back side of Woodglenn Park there was a playground and a men’s and women’s bathroom building. Some teenagers one day were playing a prank on a young man and locked him in the bathroom so he could not get out the building caught on fire and the young man was killed. Some say it was a prank gone badly and some say it was murder. If you are walking down that sidewalk late at night you can here screams and also something in the large Cottonwood Trees that still stand above where the bathroom used to be. Now there is a new playground there but the spirit still remains. It is said that after you have heard these noises that you feel like someone is chasing you, like the boy wants to chase you down. May 2008 Correction: The building is still there. It is no longer being used as a bathroom, even though there is faded print on one of the doors that says women’s. The doors are locked and there are two port-a-potties on the side to replace the bathrooms. Also there are two trees really close to the building. One of the trees has no bark on the side of the trunk that is facing the building (likely from the fire). Oh and one more thing.

Estes Park	United States	Gordon and Ethel Mace built this charming lodge in 1917, and it stayed in their family until 1986 when the family lost ownership of it. Not to deter Ethel, however, who has haunted her old room for years. She especially likes to sit in a wing-backed rocker before a fireplace in what is now a storage room, her feet up, reading the Bible. Gordon hates smoking. Few guests are able to keep a cigarette lit for long - something smashes it out or steals the pack! Ethel must be somewhat of a prohibitionist, because mixed drinks seem to spill and fly off tables fairly often.

Fort Carson	United States	The old hospital and other surrounding buildings in this area were built around 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the 40's there were a lot of German and Italian POW's located on Ft. Carson. There is also an intricate system of tunnels linking the buildings together, one of the post's Military Police investigated an open door one night and deep into one of the tunnels he found an old setup of children’s toys, a small chair, a small kids table and a few other things. There were also witnessed by three Military Policeman words painted inside an area under the building with no visible way to get inside and paint them there. The words didn't make any sense, and when they attempted to look for them on a later date they were gone, as if they’d never been there. They weren't painted over because the surface wasn't painted, and they weren't sandblasted off either. On some nights especially when the weather gets colder, many strange noises are heard there. Movement is heard through the building, like furniture is being shoved around, repetitive banging noise, and sometimes faces are seen peering through the barred windows. an elder American Indian woman says the site was directly on the old trail of tears. She said that, there is a large low-lying field where no structure will stand; several attempts at building there have been unsuccessful.	The old Ft.

Poncha Springs	United States	A civil war haunting is present just off the highway on the north side of the pass on a big curve, where according to Union Army records, a small contingent of troops encountered a renegade bunch of Southern soldiers running from a posse of mounted volunteers. It seems they had been sent by the South to intercept a gold shipment and take it back to Texas. They were successful in stealing the gold shipment on a wagon and had almost crossed Poncha Pass when they ran into a Union patrol form Ft Garland. A small skirmish ensued where three rebels were killed and most of the gold was retaken. Two soldiers that were wounded carried off one of the four wooden crates of gold and ran to the south up little Pemmican Creek where they disappeared for all time. Some say they left the area, and some have said they died in the dense woods and aspen groves from their wounds. The Union patrol searched for many days but could not find any trace of them. The three Southern soldiers who had been killed are buried in the Poncha Springs Little Round Top Cemetery. Local ranchers and miners have reported seeing a old man in tattered grey uniform feebly asking for help, but when they would go to help him, they could never find him. Motorists along this stretch of Hwy 285 have seen a older man in tattered clothes saluting as they passed. The sheriff was called on several occasions to investigate, but no one was ever found. Scouts and adults at the scout base along Pemmican Creek have reported seeing a strange looking grey ghostly figure in early evening while they camped out there.

Thornton	United States	"Riverdale Road is a circuitous and meandering stretch of poorly maintained country road running primarily from northeast Denver then north to Highway 7 in Brighton. The road is within a distinctly rural area currently and derives its name from its parallel relationship to the South Platte River. Between the road and the west riverbank is a dense alluvial soil which is rich and fertile which attributes a long history to the road. The area was not farmed in the traditional sense until the late 1880's and there was never any official form of slavery on any of these farms, yet there is a definite sense of the arcane and tragic. Unlike the officially platted roads of the Colorado highway system, Riverdale is very curvy and follows the bank of the South Platte, belying its original usage as a section of the so-called Trapper, or Cherokee Trail, used by the indigenous inhabitants of the area for nearly 1500 years before contact with the Europeans in 1817. Little is known about the place during this time. What is well documented is the time period from 1880-1950's when the area was part of the large truck farm complex, primarily of Sugar Beets. The harvesting of the Beets would occur during the fall and was done by abjectly poor eastern European immigrants who worked the Smelters the remainder of the year. As a result the farms were notorious for their abuses of the migrant workers to the point of near slavery, a tragedy which continues today. This, along with the many pioneers and such who died traveling Cherokee trail has riddled it with angry and unpleasant spirit activity. In addition to the aforementioned legend there is a place, some miles south of Highway seven and near to the northernmost end of the road which is distinctly hilly, uncommonly so. The hills are some 300' in height and uniform in shape. These hills surround a large building and a residence known to local teenagers as the ""gates of hell"". The legend which surrounds this place is that some time in the early 1980's a bizarre and abusive religious cult was cloistered there where they would commit unknown heresies, including the death of a child. To this day it is said, that at certain times, a number of phantom dogs can be seen guarding the driveway and have even gone so far as to chase some people into their cars, a point at which, they disappear without a trace."
